Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

 Let's analyze each choice with regard to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements extracted clearly identify the obligations of **Member States** regarding **customers**.
   - Each statement is precise and reflects a different aspect of the directive, ensuring that the focal actors are highlighted.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The extracted statements do not include any clauses that start with "if," which means that preconditions are not explicitly represented in this choice. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also effectively captures the obligations of **Member States** concerning **customers**.
   - The phrasing is slightly different but maintains clarity and specificity.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Like Choice 1, there are no statements that incorporate clauses beginning with "if," leaving preconditions unaddressed.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements in this choice also identify the obligations of **Member States** but use "must" instead of "shall ensure." This may imply a stronger obligation, which could be beneficial in legal interpretations.
   - However, it uses "customers" instead of "all customers," which could be considered less specific.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - This choice similarly lacks any "if" clauses, failing to demonstrate any preconditions that could be derived from the article.

### Conclusion:
All three choices successfully extract atomic statements from the law article, focusing on the perspectives of **Member States** and **customers**. However, none of the choices adequately address preconditions, as none of them include clauses that begin with "if."

Between the three, Choice 1 and Choice 2 are effectively the same in terms of content, while Choice 3 employs a slightly different wording that could be interpreted as more assertive. However, the use of "customers" instead of "all customers" in Choice 3 may reduce its specificity, making it less aligned with the directive's language.

Given that all choices fail to address preconditions and Choices 1 and 2 are essentially equivalent, I conclude that:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement captures the essence of the law article, focusing on both the Member States and the Customers. 
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - This is another correct representation of the article, again focusing on the relevant actors.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement correctly indicates a requirement that Member States need to fulfill, but it does not directly involve the Customers.

**Analysis**: All the statements are correctly extracted, and the focus on both Member States and Customers is appropriate. However, the last statement is more about the obligation of the Member States and does not directly address the Customers.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This is a correct extraction, maintaining the focus on both Member States and Customers.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - This is also a precise representation that includes the necessary actors.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.
   - Similar to Choice 1, this statement reflects the obligation of Member States without a direct implication for Customers.

**Analysis**: The statements are correctly extracted. The focus is on the relevant actors, but, like Choice 1, the last statement is more administrative and does not directly involve the Customers.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This is a valid extraction but uses "must" instead of "shall." The term "must" may imply a stronger obligation, but it does not change the meaning significantly. 

2. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - This statement is also valid and maintains the focus on Customers.

3. **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This is again a correct representation of the obligations of Member States.

**Analysis**: While the use of "must" may add a sense of urgency or obligation, it does not significantly change the atomic statements extracted. All statements accurately reflect the law article and appropriately involve both Member States and Customers.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all three choices based on the criteria, it appears that all choices successfully extract atomic statements from the law article. However, Choices 1 and 2 are nearly identical, and they both pay attention to the focal actors, but their last statements do not directly involve Customers. Choice 3 successfully maintains the focus on Customers while slightly changing the tone of obligation.

Nonetheless, all choices fulfill the requirements to some extent, but Choice 3 provides a slight edge in terms of clearly focusing on the Customers while still addressing the Member States' obligations.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice accurately extracts atomic statements from the law article, focusing on the perspective of Member States and customers. It captures the rights of customers effectively.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no conditional statements (clauses starting with "if") in this choice. However, it captures the necessary conditions for customers to exercise their rights.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice is identical to Choice 1, thus it also successfully extracts atomic statements and addresses the perspectives of Member States and customers.
- **Criterion 2**: Similar to Choice 1, it does not include any conditional clauses, but it does include the necessary conditions for customer rights.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States must ensure that customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States must ensure that customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice modifies the language from "shall" to "must," which can imply a stronger obligation. It also uses "customers" without the qualifier "all," which may overlook any specificity regarding the customer base. However, it still reflects the perspective of the focal actors adequately.
- **Criterion 2**: Like the previous choices, it lacks any conditional clauses. It captures the obligations of Member States effectively.

### Conclusion:
All choices successfully extract atomic statements, but Choices 1 and 2 maintain the original phrasing of the law article and specify "all customers," which may be important for legal clarity and comprehensiveness. Choice 3 introduces a stronger obligation but loses specificity by omitting “all” in reference to customers.

Considering both criteria and the need for clarity in legal language, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement accurately reflects the legal requirement and identifies both the focal actor (Member States) and the affected party (customers).
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - Similar to the first statement, this captures the essence of the law and identifies the actors appropriately.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement is also clear and identifies the action that must be taken, relevant to the focal actors.

**Criterion 1** is satisfied as the atomic statements are derived correctly from the perspective of both Member States and customers. **Criterion 2** is also satisfied as it reflects the requirement for conditions that must be met.

---

**Choice 2:**
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement is identical to the first statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria effectively.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - Again, this is identical to the second statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This is also identical to the third statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria.

While this choice effectively captures the same statements and identifies the actors, it does not introduce any new variations or insights into the atomic statements. Thus, it does not enhance the analysis compared to Choice 1.

---

**Choice 3:**
1. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This statement simplifies the description but loses the explicit mention of "all customers," which may not emphasize the legal scope adequately. It still captures the essence of the requirement.

2. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - Similar to the first statement, this does not specify "all customers," which could lead to ambiguity.

3. **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This statement remains clear but, again, lacks the emphasis on "all customers."

Although Choice 3 maintains a focus on the focal actors, it does not fully satisfy **Criterion 1** as it does not explicitly include "all customers," which is essential for the legal clarity required in GRL models. It also does not delineate any specific preconditions related to "if" clauses effectively.

### Conclusion
The best choice is 1, as it fully meets both criteria regarding the extraction of atomic statements and preconditions while clearly identifying the focal actors. 

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively extracts atomic statements relevant to the focal actors, Member States and Customers. It clearly delineates the responsibilities of Member States and the rights granted to Customers.
- **Criterion 2**: It does not address preconditions, as it does not identify any clauses that begin with "if."

### Choice 2:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice is nearly identical to Choice 1. It accurately captures the atomic statements from the perspective of Member States and Customers.
- **Criterion 2**: Similar to Choice 1, it fails to identify preconditions for clauses starting with "if."

### Choice 3:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively captures the atomic statements but uses "must" instead of "shall." This might affect the legal interpretation but still conveys the same responsibilities of Member States.
- **Criterion 2**: Like the previous choices, it does not identify preconditions for clauses starting with "if."

### Conclusion:
While all choices effectively extract atomic legal statements relevant to Member States and Customers, none of the choices fulfill the second criterion regarding the extraction of preconditions. However, Choices 1 and 2 are identical in terms of content and accurately reflect the legal language of the directive. Both Choices 1 and 2 provide a clearer distinction of the responsibilities assigned to Member States and the rights of Customers without introducing the potential ambiguity of "must" as in Choice 3.

 To determine the best choice based on the given domain description and criteria, I will analyze each choice in detail.

### Analysis of Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: The action clearly states that Member States must ensure freedom of choice for customers regarding electricity suppliers.
  2. Obligation: The action states the freedom for customers to hold multiple contracts, again an obligation for Member States.
  3. Obligation: This statement mandates the establishment of necessary infrastructure.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: All actions are described without preconditions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: Ensures freedom for customers to choose suppliers.
  2. Obligation: Ensures customers can have multiple contracts.
  3. Obligation: Mandates the establishment of connections and metering points.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: Actions are described without preconditions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: Freedom of choice for customers.
  2. Obligation: Freedom to have multiple contracts.
  3. Obligation: Establishment of metering points is required.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: No preconditions are included in the actions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that they all satisfy both criteria. However, Choices 1 and 2 contain slightly different phrasing around "ensure" and "provide," which does not impact the legal implications. All choices maintain the requirement of obligations without preconditions.

Since all choices meet the criteria perfectly, I will select the first choice as the best due to its clarity and directness in stating obligations without introducing alternative terminology that could lead to ambiguity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Action(s):** The actions are described as ensuring that customers are free to purchase electricity and have multiple supply contracts. However, the third statement does not directly refer to an action of the Member States but rather a condition that must be met (establishing connection and metering points). This may imply a precondition that is not aligned with Criterion 1.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2. 

However, due to the wording of the third statement, it may not fully align with the requirement that actions should not include preconditions. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Action(s):** Similar to Choice 1, the actions are clearly stated. However, the use of "provide that" instead of "ensure that" does not change the essence of the obligations but does introduce a slightly different implication for the actions. The third statement still indicates a requirement that must be established, which could imply a precondition.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, satisfying Criterion 2. 

Again, the third statement's phrasing suggests a potential precondition that contradicts Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. **Action(s):** The actions in this choice are described as ensuring that customers are free to purchase electricity and have multiple contracts. The third statement, "ensure that the required connection and metering points are established," also reflects a requirement; however, the structure maintains a focus on the obligations of the Member States without explicit mention of preconditions.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, meeting Criterion 2.

This choice maintains clarity in action description and aligns most closely with the stated criteria.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the three choices, Choice 3 best adheres to both criteria by clearly outlining obligations without including preconditions in the descriptions of actions. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail while adhering to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - The actions clearly describe what Member States are obliged to ensure for customers without mentioning any preconditions. This aligns with Criterion 1.
   - Each statement is classified correctly as an obligation, satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification of actions and modalities is consistent and correctly captures the obligations imposed on Member States.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the actions describe what Member States must ensure without including preconditions, meeting Criterion 1.
   - However, the use of "provide that" instead of "ensure" could introduce ambiguity regarding the nature of the obligation, as "provide" might imply a different form of responsibility. 

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification remains consistent, and all actions are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2. Despite this, the alteration in wording could be seen as a negative aspect.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Like the previous choices, the actions clearly articulate the obligations without preconditions, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   - The statements maintain clarity and adhere to the original language of the article, which is a positive aspect.

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification is consistent and accurately reflects the obligations of the Member States, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the choices, both Choice 1 and Choice 3 comply with the criteria effectively, with clear actions and appropriate classifications. Choice 2, while mostly compliant, introduces potentially ambiguous wording that could detract from clarity. 

Thus, the best choice is 3, as it maintains the original language and clarity of obligations without introducing any ambiguity. 

The best choice is 3.

- **Criterion 1:** The choice does not include preconditions in the description of actions, which is compliant.
- **Criterion 2:** All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations. 

### Conclusion:
All three choices satisfy the criteria laid out; however, Choices 1 and 3 maintain the original phrasing with "ensure" as an action verb, while Choice 2 replaces it with "provide," which slightly alters the original intent of the directive. Based on the consistency and preservation of the original directive's tone, the best choice is 1.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are correctly extracted.
   - Each of the actions described does not include any preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - All statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate for the context of the article. However, the third statement is more about ensuring the establishment of infrastructure rather than a direct obligation to customers, which could be seen as a permission rather than an obligation.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are accurately extracted.
   - The actions do not include preconditions, complying with Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - Each statement is classified as an obligation, which is appropriate. However, the wording "provide that" might introduce ambiguity regarding whether it implies a direct obligation or just a facilitation of conditions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are accurately extracted.
   - The actions do not include preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - Each statement is classified as an obligation, which aligns with the legal language and intent of the article. This choice maintains clarity and directness without introducing ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, Choice 3 maintains the clearest representation of the obligations without introducing potential ambiguity in the wording. It also meets both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is 3.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the criteria provided, focusing on the extraction and modeling of legal statements from Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: There are no preconditions mentioned in the extracted statements, which means no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition exist to serve as sources for Dependencies. This does not satisfy Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: Since there are no preconditions, there cannot be any Dependencies where the source is a Precondition and the target is either an Obligation or a Permission. Thus, Criterion 2 is not satisfied.
3. **Duplication**: Each goal is described uniquely, and there are no duplicates in the descriptions, which satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions specified in the extracted statements, meaning no Goal with modality Precondition exists. This fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: Again, due to the lack of preconditions, there are no Dependencies to analyze regarding sources and targets. This fails Criterion 2 as well.
3. **Duplication**: This model, like Choice 1, does not have duplicated elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: As with the previous choices, there are no preconditions present in the extracted legal statements, which means there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition. This does not satisfy Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: The absence of preconditions means there are no possibilities for Dependencies where the source is a Precondition and the target is either an Obligation or a Permission, failing Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: This model successfully avoids duplication of elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:

All three choices fail to meet the critical Criteria 1 and 2 regarding the presence of preconditions and the creation of dependencies. However, they all meet Criterion 3 by avoiding duplication.

Given that all choices are fundamentally similar and do not satisfy the essential criteria, the best choice is the first one simply because it is the first presented option and serves as a baseline for the analysis.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: None of the intentional elements identified have a precondition as stated in the classification. Therefore, this choice does not meet Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: Since there are no preconditions, there cannot be any dependencies established between a precondition and obligations or permissions, which violates Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications of model elements in this choice, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions for the intentional elements, which fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The absence of preconditions also means there are no dependencies that can be established, violating Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: No duplication of model elements occurs in this choice, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: Like the previous choices, there are no preconditions in the intentional elements, which fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The lack of preconditions means there are also no dependencies established, violating Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications of model elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria due to the absence of preconditions and dependencies. However, they each satisfy Criterion 3 regarding duplication. Since all choices are structurally similar and do not fulfill the critical requirements of the model, they cannot be distinguished in terms of a "best" choice based on the criteria provided.

Given that there are no effective differences in the fulfillment of the criteria across the choices, **the best choice is 1** (arbitrarily selecting the first choice, as all have similar shortcomings). 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the established criteria to determine which model best represents the requirements outlined in Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: None of the intentional elements in the model have a precondition. This means there are no IntentionalElements of type Goal with modality Precondition serving as the source of a Dependency. **(Fails Criterion 1)**
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model has no dependencies at all, so it does not provide a source of a Dependency that aligns with the requirements. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: The model does not have any duplicated intentional elements; each goal is unique in its description. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions in any of the intentional elements. **(Fails Criterion 1)** 

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model does not include any dependencies, thereby not meeting the requirement for a source of Dependency. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplications; each intentional element is distinct. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: As with the previous choices, there are no IntentionalElements with modality Precondition, which means there are no sources for Dependencies. **(Fails Criterion 1)**

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: This model also does not establish any dependencies, failing to provide a source that would align with the necessary criteria. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicated intentional elements in this model either, as each goal is described uniquely. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Conclusion:

All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria regarding preconditions and dependencies, which are critical for the intended legal GRL modeling. However, they all successfully avoid duplication of model elements. Since none of the choices fulfill the core requirements effectively, it is challenging to deem one as better than the others.

Given the analysis, the best choice among the provided options is technically non-existent as none meet all criteria. However, since they all share the same shortcomings and strengths, I will select the first one as a representative option for further refinement.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: There are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition in the model.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: The source of any dependencies must be a Precondition, and the targets must be either an Obligation or a Permission. Since there are no Preconditions, this criterion is not satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: There are no duplicate model elements; each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: There are no dependencies defined, and again, there are no Preconditions to serve as sources for these dependencies.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: No duplicates are present in this model either.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: Just like the previous choices, this model does not contain any intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: There are no dependencies defined, and the absence of Preconditions means that the requirement cannot be satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: There are no duplicate elements; each intentional element is distinct.

### Conclusion

All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria, as they do not include any Precondition elements nor dependencies stemming from them. However, all choices satisfy Criterion 3 by avoiding duplication. Based on the analysis, none of the choices are fully compliant with the requirements of the model.

In terms of the least problematic choice, since all choices are structurally similar and fail on the same criteria, it comes down to preference in formatting and clarity. However, since each option is essentially equivalent in this context, we can select the first choice as it represents the original extraction and classification without any additional layers of complexity.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."

2. **Dependency Source and Target**:
   - There are no Dependencies defined in this model. It does not meet Criterion 2.

   - Similar to Choice 1, there are no Preconditions present. It fails Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**:
   - There are no Dependencies defined in this model. It does not meet Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplications in model elements, so it meets Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Precondition Requirement**:
   - Again, there are no Preconditions present, which means it fails Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**:
   - There are no Dependencies defined in this model. It does not meet Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - The model does not contain duplications, so it meets Criterion 3.

### Conclusion

After analyzing all three choices, none of them satisfy the essential criteria of having a Precondition, having defined Dependencies, and avoiding duplication of model elements. However, all choices are consistent in terms of the lack of Preconditions and Dependencies, and they do not contain duplicate model elements.

Since all choices share similar deficiencies but maintain unique characteristics without duplication, the best choice among them for clarity in representation and organization is:

**The best choice is 1.**

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Member States and Customers.

The model is created using the following domain:
Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944: Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'
    'id:' id=ID
    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?
;

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

EL: Contribution | Decomposition | Dependency;

Contribution: 'Contribution:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
    'level:' level=INT

Decomposition: 'Decomposition:'
    'source:' source=[IE]

    'decompositionType:' decompositionType=decompositionType
;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
#### Step 1: Analyze and Rewrite Descriptions in Propositional Logic
1. **IE1**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - P1: All customers are free to purchase from supplier of their choice.
   
   Propositional Logic: 
   - A: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.

2. **IE2**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - P2: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

   Propositional Logic:
   - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

3. **IE3**: The required connection and metering points are established.
   - P3: The required connection and metering points are established.

   Propositional Logic:
   - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 2: Create Syntax Tree
The descriptions are simple propositions without complex logical connectors, so the syntax tree is as follows:

```
       AND
       /   \
      A     B
```

#### Step 3: Create Sub Intentional Elements
1. **IE1** becomes:
   - **IE1_A**: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.
   - **IE1_AND**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and have more than one electricity supply contract.

2. **IE2** becomes:
   - **IE2_B**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **IE3** becomes:
   - **IE3_C**: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 4: Connect Elements with Decompositions
```
Decomposition of IE1:
- IE1 -> IE1_A
```
```
Decomposition of IE2:
- IE2 -> IE2_B
```
```
Decomposition of IE3:
- IE3 -> IE3_C
```

#### Step 5: Contribution Links
- Contribution from **IE1** to **IE1_A**: level = 100
- Contribution from **IE2** to **IE2_B**: level = 100

### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

**Refine Legal GRL model:**

1. **Obligation 1 (IE1)**: Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - Propositional Logic: A
     - A: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.

2. **Obligation 2 (IE2)**: Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - Propositional Logic: B
     - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **Obligation 3 (IE3)**: Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - Propositional Logic: C
     - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

Since all atomic statements are obligations and do not have interdependencies or complex conditions needing decomposition, the refined GRL model does not require additional preconditions or permissions.

                id: "IE2"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            Dependency:
                  source: "IE3"
                  target: "IE2"
;

    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE1
        target: IE2
    ;
    
    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE1
        target: IE3
    ;
    
    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE2
        target: IE3
    ;
```

In this refined model, we have maintained the obligations as distinct entities, ensuring clarity about the responsibilities of Member States without introducing unnecessary complexities. Each obligation stands independently, reflecting the duties outlined in the article.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
To refine the model, we will analyze each obligation in the context of their propositional logic and create a hierarchical structure as per the steps outlined.

1. **Obligation 1**: "Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - Proposition: A: all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.

2. **Obligation 2**: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - Proposition: B: all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **Obligation 3**: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."
   - Proposition: C: the required connection and metering points are established.

Since each obligation does not contain any logical connectors that require further decomposition, we will keep them as is.

Thus, the refined Legal GRL model remains simple without nested structures:

```
Model:
    actors = Actor:
        name: "Member States"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE1"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE2"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            Dependency:
                  source: "IE3"
                  target: "IE2"
;
```

In this case, the obligations are clear and straightforward, thus no additional preconditions or permissions are necessary to support the obligations as described in the legal article.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice with respect to the stated criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition presented in this choice adheres to the criterion that only Intentional Elements of the same type and modality are decomposed. Here, all decompositions involve Obligations, which satisfies this criterion. 
2. **Target Criterion**: The decomposition of **IE1**, **IE2**, and **IE3** is into a single element, failing to meet this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition involves only Obligations for all elements, satisfying the first criterion.
2. **Target Criterion**: The model presents dependencies between the Intentional Elements, but it does not utilize decomposition that targets multiple elements from a single source. This choice fails to demonstrate a proper application of decomposition as required by the second criterion.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: As with the previous choices, this model maintains the integrity of only decomposing Obligations into Obligations, satisfying the first criterion.
2. **Target Criterion**: This choice also presents independent Obligations without any decomposition, leading to a failure in demonstrating the required connections among Intentional Elements. It does not effectively utilize the opportunity for decomposition to meet the criterion of having multiple targets.

### Conclusion:
Both Choice 1 and Choice 2 introduce some decomposition, but Choice 1 fails the second criterion due to decomposing an Obligation into a single target. Choice 2 does not demonstrate proper decomposition. Choice 3 keeps things simple but fails to leverage the opportunities for decomposition as well. 

After careful consideration of the criteria, the best choice is Choice 1, as it at least attempted to decompose with valid elements, despite failing the second criterion on one instance.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the choices presented for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, we will analyze each one based on the provided criteria. 

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model successfully decomposes "IE1" into "IE1_A" and "IE2" into "IE2_B", which are both of the same type (Goal) and modality (Obligation). This adheres to Criterion 1. "IE3" is not decomposed further, which is acceptable.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: "IE1", "IE2" and "IE3" has a single decomposition target but does not violate any rules as it's a singular obligation.

**Summary**: This choice maintains a clear structure and follows the decomposition rules well, making it a strong candidate.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model does not provide any decomposition. All elements remain distinct obligations without any further breakdown. This does not contradict Criterion 1 but lacks the depth that decomposition could provide.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Since there is no decomposition, Criterion 2 is not applicable here. Each obligation stands independently, which can be seen as a limitation in capturing the relationships among obligations.

**Summary**: While this model clearly outlines the obligations, it misses the opportunity for more complex relationships through decomposition, making it less robust than Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 2, this model does not include any decomposition. All obligations are presented as separate entities without further breakdown, adhering to Criterion 1 but lacking the potential for deeper analysis.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Again, there is no decomposition, so Criterion 2 is not applicable. The obligations are presented independently, which may limit the representation of the relationships between them.

**Summary**: Like Choice 2, this choice clearly defines the obligations but lacks any form of decomposition, making it less effective in capturing the complexities of the legal requirements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that Choice 1 provides the most comprehensive model. It effectively uses decomposition to represent the relationships among obligations while adhering to both criteria. Choice 2 and Choice 3, while clear, do not utilize decomposition and therefore miss the opportunity to capture the interconnectedness of the obligations.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations into related intentional elements. Each obligation is clearly defined without mixing different modalities (all are obligations).
   - The decomposition of **IE1** into **IE1_A** and **IE2** into **IE2_B** aligns with Criterion 1. However, **IE3** is treated as a standalone element without decomposition, which is acceptable since it does not have additional sub-elements.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of **IE1**, **IE2** and **IE3** stands alone and does not require decomposition, which does not violate this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations are well-defined and classified correctly. However, it introduces unnecessary dependencies between the obligations, which could complicate the model without adding value.
   - This choice does not decompose obligations into sub-elements, which is acceptable but may miss potential relationships.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The dependencies create a single chain of obligations rather than allowing for multiple independent intentional elements. This could lead to a violation of Criterion 2 since it may imply that one obligation depends on another unnecessarily.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - This model does not attempt to decompose the intentional elements at all, which may limit the expressiveness of the model. Each obligation is treated as independent and does not explore potential relationships.
   - The lack of decomposition misses opportunities to clarify how different obligations may support or relate to one another.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Since there are no decompositions in this choice, it does not present any issues with Criterion 2. However, it also means that the model lacks depth and interconnectivity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices against the criteria, **Choice 1** provides the most comprehensive and structured model while adhering to both decomposition criteria. It successfully captures the obligations of the Member States without introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To determine the best choice for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model describes a decomposition of **IE1** into **IE1_A** and **IE2** into **IE2_B**, which are **Obligations**. This adheres to Criterion 1 since it only decomposes **Obligations**.
   - Additionally, **IE3** is decomposed into **IE3_C**, which is also an **Obligation**. This complies with Criterion 1.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - **IE1** is decomposed into one element (**IE1_A**),which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   - **IE2** is decomposed into one element (**IE2_B**), which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   - **IE3** is decomposed into one element (**IE3_C**), which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - There is no decomposition performed in this choice. All obligations are presented as distinct without any hierarchical relationship. This does not infringe on Criterion 1 but also does not utilize the potential of decomposition effectively.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Since there is no decomposition, Criterion 2 is not applicable here.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, there is no decomposition of the obligations. The obligations are listed independently without creating any sub-elements.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Like Choice 2, there is no decomposition, making Criterion 2 not applicable.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices:
- Choice 1 performs decomposition correctly but fails to meet Criterion 2 with **IE3**.
- Choices 2 and 3 do not utilize decomposition at all and thus do not provide advantages in terms of modeling complexity.

Given the importance of fulfilling both criteria, no choice fully meets the requirements. However, since Choice 1 makes an attempt to establish a structured model (despite its flaw), it is the most advanced among the options provided.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations (IE1, IE2, and IE3) into their respective elements. However, it introduces a decomposition of IE1, IE2 into two sub-elements (IE1_A and IE2_B) which is suitable since both are of the same modality (Obligation) and type (Goal).
   - The decomposition of IE3 into IE3_C is also appropriate since it follows the same modality and type.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of IE1 targets one element (IE1_A), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE2 targets one element (IE2_B), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE3 targets one element (IE3_C), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model does not decompose any of the obligations. While this is acceptable since they are independent, the lack of decomposition does not utilize the potential for a more detailed structure.
   - Dependencies are introduced, but this does not meet the criteria for decomposition between Intentional Elements.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The dependencies created do not target more than one element, which fails Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, the model does not decompose any obligations. This could imply that the statements are too simple to require decomposition, but it misses an opportunity to structure them in a way that might clarify their interrelations.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - As with Choice 2, there are no decompositions targeting multiple elements; thus, it does not satisfy Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
- **Choice 1** presents a more structured approach with the decomposition of obligations, even though it fails on the target decomposition of IE3. 
- **Choices 2 and 3** do not utilize decomposition at all, which limits their effectiveness in expressing the obligations clearly.

Given the analysis, while Choice 1 has a slight shortcoming, it still offers the best structure for understanding the obligations laid out in the legal article, particularly from the perspective of the focal actors. 

The best choice is **1**.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
#### Step 1: Analyze and Rewrite Descriptions in Propositional Logic
1. **IE1**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - P1: All customers are free to purchase from supplier of their choice.
   
   Propositional Logic: 
   - A: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.

2. **IE2**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - P2: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

   Propositional Logic:
   - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

3. **IE3**: The required connection and metering points are established.
   - P3: The required connection and metering points are established.

   Propositional Logic:
   - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 2: Create Syntax Tree
The descriptions are simple propositions without complex logical connectors, so the syntax tree is as follows:

```
       AND
       /   \
      A     B
```

#### Step 3: Create Sub Intentional Elements
1. **IE1** becomes:
   - **IE1_A**: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.
   - **IE1_AND**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and have more than one electricity supply contract.

2. **IE2** becomes:
   - **IE2_B**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **IE3** becomes:
   - **IE3_C**: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 4: Connect Elements with Decompositions
```
Decomposition of IE1:
- IE1 -> IE1_A
```
```
Decomposition of IE2:
- IE2 -> IE2_B
```
```
Decomposition of IE3:
- IE3 -> IE3_C
```

#### Step 5: Contribution Links
- Contribution from **IE1** to **IE1_A**: level = 100
- Contribution from **IE2** to **IE2_B**: level = 100

 Let’s analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement captures the freedom of customers to choose their electricity supplier, which is an atomic statement from the perspective of **customers**.
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**, provided that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement captures another atomic statement regarding customers' freedom to have multiple contracts. However, it does not clearly delineate the precondition regarding the establishment of connection and metering points, as it is embedded within the statement.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - Similar to Choice 1, this statement captures the freedom of customers effectively.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - This statement also captures the atomic statement accurately from the customer's perspective.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the required connection and metering points are **established**.
   - This statement separates the requirement for connection and metering points as an atomic statement, which is commendable. However, it lacks the precondition context that is needed for clauses starting with “if.”

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This is well-formed and captures the atomic statement for customers effectively.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, **provided that** the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This statement captures the atomic statement regarding customers' freedom and properly includes the precondition (i.e., "provided that the required connection and metering points are established"), making it clear that this is a condition that must be met.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of each choice against the criteria:

- **Choice 1** fails to separate the precondition adequately.
- **Choice 2** lacks the contextual precondition for the clauses.
- **Choice 3** effectively captures both atomic statements and preconditions.

Thus, "The best choice is 3."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To determine the best choice for extracting atomic statements from Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944, I will analyze each option based on the specified criteria.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** This choice successfully extracts two atomic statements that reflect the obligations of Member States and the rights of customers. The statements are clear and represent the legal obligations well.
2. **Preconditions:** The second statement contains a precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established"), but it is not explicitly separated. This could lead to confusion regarding the conditional nature of the obligation.

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** This option extracts three statements. The first two statements reflect the obligations of Member States, while the third statement introduces a new obligation regarding establishing connection and metering points. However, it loses the conditional aspect, as it separates the precondition from the obligation.
2. **Preconditions:** The precondition regarding the establishment of connection and metering points is presented as a standalone statement, which is not aligned with the conditional nature of the original law article. This choice fails to maintain the link between the condition and the obligations.

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** This choice also successfully extracts two atomic statements. It retains the focus on the rights of customers and the obligations of Member States. The inclusion of "provided that" in the second statement ensures that the conditional nature of the obligation is clear.
2. **Preconditions:** The precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established") is included as part of the statement, maintaining the relationship between the obligation and its condition. This is crucial for accurately reflecting the legal nuance of the article.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all choices against the criteria, Choice 3 stands out as it successfully captures both the atomic legal statements and the conditional precondition without losing the relationship between them. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate each choice based on the specified criteria, we will analyze how well they extract atomic statements and preconditions from the law article concerning both Member States and Customers.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**. 
   - This statement captures the essence of the law, making it clear that customers have the freedom to choose their supplier.
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**, provided that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement covers the second right of customers but integrates the precondition within the statement itself. However, the clause "provided that" could be clearer in its separation as a precondition.

**Analysis**: Choice 1 effectively captures atomic statements but lacks a clear separation of preconditions, which could confuse the understanding of the conditions under which the rights apply.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This captures the freedom to choose a supplier but loses some specificity in the phrasing ("free to purchase" instead of "free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice").

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - This is a straightforward statement but lacks the precondition.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the required connection and metering points are **established**.
   - This statement is extracted correctly but is somewhat separate from the context of the freedom granted to customers.

**Analysis**: Choice 2 extracts various atomic statements but divides the information too much, diluting the connection between the rights of customers and the associated preconditions. It also fails to clearly indicate the precondition in the context of the rights.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This statement is clear and captures the freedom to choose suppliers effectively.
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, **provided that** the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This statement retains the element of the precondition in a clear manner, making it evident that the freedom to have multiple contracts is contingent upon the establishment of necessary connections and metering points.

**Analysis**: Choice 3 maintains clarity and effectively separates the rights from their conditions, thus providing a better representation of the law article.

### Conclusion:
Considering the clarity of atomic statements and the proper extraction of preconditions, the best choice is Choice 3. It provides a coherent representation of the law article while fulfilling both criteria effectively.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice against the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: This choice extracts atomic statements effectively from the law article. It captures the essence of the obligations imposed on Member States regarding customer freedoms.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The phrase "provided that the required connection and metering points are established" is included as part of the second statement but does not clearly qualify as a precondition because it is not prefixed by "if". The structure indicates it is a condition but not in the standard "if... then..." format typically used for preconditions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: This choice extracts atomic statements clearly, but it separates the establishment of connection and metering points into a different statement. While this can be seen as a more granular approach, it loses the relationship of that condition to the previous statements.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The conditions are not explicitly framed as preconditions. The phrase "provided that" is used, which does imply a conditionality, but it isn't framed in the conventional "if... then..." format.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively extracts atomic statements, maintaining the integrity of the obligations of Member States while ensuring that both freedoms for customers are clearly articulated.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The phrase "provided that" still does not explicitly fit the "if... then..." model, but it is the closest to indicating a precondition related to the freedoms outlined. It implies that the freedoms are contingent upon the establishment of the required connection and metering points.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the choices based on the criteria, while none perfectly fit both criteria, Choice 3 provides a clearer structure of the obligations of Member States and maintains the conditional relationship within a single statement, making it the most suitable option. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**. 
   - This statement captures the essence of the law as it reflects the freedom of customers to choose their electricity supplier. It does not break down the components sufficiently but maintains a clear focus on the act of ensuring.
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**, provided that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement also captures the essential elements of the law, including the condition (precondition) that must be met for the freedom to hold multiple contracts. However, it does not clearly separate the precondition from the main condition.

**Analysis**: This choice effectively captures the main statements, but it does not clearly delineate the precondition from the primary statements, which may be important for clarity and understanding.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This statement is similar to Choice 1 but makes the action of "purchasing" more atomic. However, it loses some clarity because it does not emphasize who is ensuring the freedom.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free to have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - This statement is also atomic but fails to capture the dependency on the establishment of connection and metering points, which is a crucial element of the law.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the required connection and metering points are **established**.
   - This statement isolates the requirement for establishing connection and metering points, which is useful but may detract from the relational context in which it operates regarding customer freedoms.

**Analysis**: While this choice extracts more atomic statements, it risks losing the context and relationships that are critical to understanding the law. The precondition is not effectively represented.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **purchase** electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This statement captures the essence clearly and maintains a focus on customer freedom.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that all **customers** are **free** to **have** more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, **provided that** the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This statement is comprehensive and effectively includes the precondition. The use of "provided that" explicitly highlights the conditions under which the freedom applies.

**Analysis**: This choice maintains the clarity of the atomic statements while also effectively communicating the precondition related to the additional freedom of having multiple contracts.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Choice 3 best adheres to both criteria by clearly extracting atomic statements from the law article and appropriately indicating preconditions. 

The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail with respect to the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
   - The actions are described correctly, with the first statement clearly indicating that customers are free to purchase electricity, and the second statement specifying that they can have multiple contracts.
  
2. **Classification and Formatting:**
   - The first statement is classified correctly as an obligation with no preconditions mentioned.
   - The second statement is also classified as an obligation; however, it contains a precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established"). This violates Criterion 1 since the action description includes a precondition.

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the actions are correctly extracted and presented.
  
2. **Classification and Formatting:**
   - The first statement is correctly classified as an obligation with no preconditions.
   - The second statement is classified as an obligation but also contains a precondition, violating Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
   - The extraction of actions is consistent with the law article, aligning with the requirement.
  
2. **Classification and Formatting:**
   - The first statement is classified as an obligation with no preconditions.
   - The second statement, however, also includes a precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established"), which violates Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All three choices extract the legal statements correctly and classify them as obligations. However, they all fail to meet Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of a precondition in the second statement of each choice. Since they perform equally poorly in this regard, there is no clear "best" choice among them based solely on the criteria provided.

Thus, the best choice is **1**, as it demonstrates the most clarity in terms of action description despite the same limitations shared by all.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze the choices based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1:**
1. The first atomic legal statement is correctly extracted and classified. It states that Member States shall ensure customers can purchase electricity. The action does not include preconditions, which satisfies Criterion 1.
2. The second statement, however, fails Criterion 1 because it includes a precondition: "provided that the required connection and metering points are established." This means the action description is not purely about the action itself.

**Choice 2:**
1. Similar to Choice 1, the first statement is correctly handled. It also meets Criterion 1.
2. The second statement again includes a precondition, which violates Criterion 1. Thus, while the first statement is correct, the second one does not meet the criteria.

**Choice 3:**
1. The first atomic legal statement is extracted and classified correctly, meeting both criteria.
2. The second statement also includes a precondition, which fails Criterion 1, just like in the previous choices.

After evaluating all three choices, it is evident that while all choices correctly extract the first atomic legal statement, they all fail to meet Criterion 1 for the second statement. However, since each choice is identical in this aspect, and all fail in the same manner, we consider their structure and adherence to classification.

Since none of the choices fully satisfy both criteria due to the inclusion of preconditions in the second statement, we will select the choice that is presented first in the analysis, which retains the same correct classification for the first statement.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the choices based on the criteria provided, we will analyze each choice one by one.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. The first atomic legal statement indicates that Member States have an obligation to ensure customers can purchase electricity from their preferred supplier. 
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice
   - **Precondition(s)**: None (meets criterion 1)
   - **Classification**: This is categorized as an obligation (meets criterion 2).

2. The second atomic legal statement also indicates that Member States must ensure customers have the freedom to hold multiple electricity contracts.
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time
   - **Precondition(s)**: the required connection and metering points are established (does not meet criterion 1).
   - **Classification**: This is categorized as an obligation (meets criterion 2).

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. The first atomic legal statement mirrors that of Choice 1.
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice
   - **Precondition(s)**: None (meets criterion 1)
   - **Classification**: Obligation (meets criterion 2).

2. The second atomic legal statement also mirrors that of Choice 1.
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time
   - **Precondition(s)**: the required connection and metering points are established (does not meet criterion 1).
   - **Classification**: Obligation (meets criterion 2).

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. The first atomic legal statement is identical to the previous choices.
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice
   - **Precondition(s)**: None (meets criterion 1)
   - **Classification**: Obligation (meets criterion 2).

2. The second atomic legal statement is also identical to the previous choices.
   - **Actor**: Member States
   - **Modal Verb**: shall
   - **Modality**: Obligation
   - **Action(s)**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time
   - **Precondition(s)**: the required connection and metering points are established (does not meet criterion 1).
   - **Classification**: Obligation (meets criterion 2).

### Conclusion:
In all three choices, the first atomic legal statement meets both criteria, while the second atomic legal statement does not meet criterion 1 due to its inclusion of preconditions. However, since Choices 1, 2, and 3 are identical in their classification and formatting, they all fail to comply fully with the criteria.

Since none of the choices fully satisfy both criteria, they are all equally flawed regarding the handling of the second atomic legal statement. However, as the task requires selecting the best choice among them and all are similar in structure and compliance, we can conclude:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: Both actions are described without preconditions in the action descriptions. 
2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first atomic statement is classified as an obligation, which is correct.
   - The second atomic statement includes a precondition related to the required connection and metering points, which violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: Similar to Choice 1, both actions do not include preconditions in the action descriptions.
2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first statement is classified as an obligation, which is correct.
   - The second statement, however, still contains a precondition about the required connection and metering points, violating Criterion 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: Like the previous choices, both actions are described without preconditions.
2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first statement is correctly classified as an obligation.
   - The second statement again includes a precondition regarding the required connection and metering points, thereby violating Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to comply with the requirement that every atomic legal statement must not include preconditions in the action descriptions, specifically in the second atomic statement. However, they do classify all atomic statements correctly as obligations.

Since all choices are fundamentally similar in effectively failing Criterion 1 due to the precondition in the second statement, but they all fulfill the obligation classification, there is no "best" choice in terms of meeting both criteria perfectly.

After careful consideration, since all choices present the same issues, the conclusion remains:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

**Choice 1:**
1. The first statement indicates that Member States have an obligation to ensure customers are free to purchase electricity. 
   - This is classified correctly as an obligation. 
   - Action(s) do not include any preconditions. 

2. The second statement also indicates an obligation by Member States but includes a precondition regarding the establishment of connection and metering points. 
   - The action does not align with the criterion since it includes a precondition.

**Choice 2:**
1. Similar to Choice 1, the first statement is classified as an obligation with no precondition, which is correct. 

2. The second statement also indicates an obligation but again includes a precondition about the connection and metering points, violating the criterion.

**Choice 3:**
1. The first statement is once again correctly classified as an obligation with no precondition, fulfilling the criteria.

2. In the second statement, while it correctly identifies the obligation, it again fails to meet the criteria due to the inclusion of the precondition.

**Conclusion:**
All three choices correctly extract the legal statements and classify the first statement without preconditions. However, all three fail to meet the criteria for the second statement due to the precondition included in their classification. Given that the descriptions in all three choices are fundamentally the same, the issue remains consistent across all options.

Since none of the choices fully satisfy both criteria, it could be concluded that none of the choices are ideal. However, since they all have the same shortcomings, we can consider them equally viable.

Thus, the best choice is 1 (Choice 1).

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the specified criteria.

**Choice 1:**
1. **Precondition**: The model includes one precondition (IE3) which states "The required connection and metering points are established".
2. **Dependency**: The dependency links this precondition (IE3) to an obligation (IE2) which is about customers being free to have more than one electricity supply contract. This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications in model elements, as the descriptions for each intentional element are unique.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: The model successfully adheres to all criteria.

---

**Choice 2:**
1. **Precondition**: A precondition (Precondition_1) is correctly identified as "the required connection and metering points are established".
2. **Dependency**: The dependency links this precondition (Precondition_1) to the obligation (Goal_2) about customers having more than one electricity supply contract. This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: The model elements are unique, with no duplications in descriptions.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: This model also adheres to all criteria.

---

**Choice 3:**
1. **Precondition**: The precondition (IE3) is present as "The required connection and metering points are established".
2. **Dependency**: The dependency correctly connects the precondition (IE3) to the obligation (IE2). This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There is a minor formatting issue in the model where a comma appears after the declaration of IE1 and IE2, which might lead to confusion in parsing the model. However, the descriptions themselves are unique.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: While it adheres to all criteria, the formatting could lead to potential implementation issues, which is a concern.

---

In summary, all three choices meet the criteria, but Choice 1 and Choice 2 are formatted more clearly without the risk of parsing errors present in Choice 3. Since there's no significant difference in adherence to the criteria, the most straightforward and error-free models are Choices 1 or 2. 

The best choice is **1** (as it presents a clear and error-free structure).
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail with respect to the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: The model includes a precondition "The required connection and metering points are established" (IE3) that serves as the source for a dependency to the goal "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time" (IE2). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Structure**: The source IE3 is indeed a precondition, and the target IE2 is an obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**: The model elements have unique descriptions and identifiers. There are no duplicates. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: The model includes a precondition "the required connection and metering points are established" (Precondition_1) that serves as the source for a dependency to the goal "ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time" (Goal_2). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Structure**: The source Precondition_1 is a precondition, and the target Goal_2 is an obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**: The model elements have unique descriptions and identifiers. There are no duplicates. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: The model includes a precondition "The required connection and metering points are established" (IE3) that serves as the source for a dependency to the goal "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time" (IE2). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Structure**: The source IE3 is a precondition, and the target IE2 is an obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**: The model elements are defined with unique descriptions and identifiers. However, there is a minor formatting issue with the commas which could lead to a misunderstanding of the syntax structure. Nonetheless, this does not affect the uniqueness of the elements. Hence, it satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:

All three choices meet the criteria, but there are formatting and structural inconsistencies in Choice 3 that could lead to potential confusion. Choices 1 and 2 are well-structured and clearly articulated.

- Choice 1 uses a more concise structure for defining the model elements.
- Choice 2 has a more explicit naming convention for the elements which could lead to better clarity.

Since both Choices 1 and 2 are valid, I will select the one that follows a cleaner structure.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices in detail based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: 
   - The model includes a precondition (IE3: "The required connection and metering points are established") which is the source of a dependency linking to an obligation (IE2: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source of the dependency is a precondition (IE3) and the target is an obligation (IE2), fulfilling Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - There are no duplicate descriptions in the model elements. Each element has a unique description. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, it correctly identifies the precondition (Precondition_1: "the required connection and metering points are established") as the source of a dependency to an obligation (Goal_2: "ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"). Thus, Criterion 1 is met.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source (Precondition_1) is a precondition and the target (Goal_2) is an obligation, satisfying Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - There are no duplicates in the model elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: 
   - Choice 3 also includes a precondition (IE3: "The required connection and metering points are established") as the source of a dependency to an obligation (IE2: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"), satisfying Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The model correctly establishes the dependency with the precondition (IE3) and the obligation (IE2), meeting Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - While it appears to have no duplicates at first glance, the formatting of the "intentionalElements" is incorrect as it uses commas instead of semicolons for separation. This could be considered a form of syntactical duplication that might lead to confusion in interpretation. Therefore, it does not fully meet Criterion 3.

### Conclusion
All choices successfully meet the first two criteria. However, Choice 3 has a syntactical formatting issue that affects clarity and could be construed as a duplication. Therefore, the best choice, with all criteria properly met and without any issues, is Choice 1.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1
1. **Precondition Source of Dependency**: 
   - The model identifies "IE3" (the required connection and metering points are established) as a Precondition and is correctly used as the source of a Dependency to "IE2" (freedom to have more than one electricity supply contract).
  
2. **Correct Dependency Types**: 
   - The source "IE3" is a Precondition, and the target "IE2" is an Obligation, which satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **No Duplication**: 
   - There are no duplicated descriptions among the intentional elements.

### Choice 2
1. **Precondition Source of Dependency**: 
   - It correctly identifies "Precondition_1" as a Precondition that serves as the source of a Dependency to "Goal_2".

2. **Correct Dependency Types**: 
   - The source "Precondition_1" (the required connection and metering points are established) is a Precondition, and "Goal_2" (freedom to have more than one electricity supply contract) is an Obligation, satisfying Criterion 2.

3. **No Duplication**: 
   - The descriptions are unique, so there is no duplication.

### Choice 3
1. **Precondition Source of Dependency**: 
   - It correctly identifies "IE3" as a Precondition linked to "IE2".

2. **Correct Dependency Types**: 
   - The source "IE3" is a Precondition, and the target "IE2" is an Obligation, meeting Criterion 2.

3. **No Duplication**: 
   - There are no duplicated descriptions.

### Conclusion
- All three choices satisfy the criteria for creating a Legal GRL model from the law article, but they differ in their formatting and naming conventions.
- Choice 1 and Choice 2 both clearly delineate the relationships and fulfill the criteria without duplications. However, Choice 1 uses a more consistent naming scheme for the intentional elements and maintains clarity and simplicity in the model structure.
- Choice 3, while meeting all criteria, has a formatting inconsistency with commas that could lead to confusion in interpretation.

Given this analysis, the best choice is **1**. Thus, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice against the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes a Precondition (IE3: "The required connection and metering points are established") that serves as the source of a Dependency. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency is formed from the source IE3 (Precondition) to the target IE2 (Obligation). This correctly follows the requirement of having a Precondition source and an Obligation target. Satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements as all intentional elements have unique descriptions. Satisfied.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: A Precondition (Precondition_1: "the required connection and metering points are established") is the source of the Dependency. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency links Precondition_1 (source) to Goal_2 (target), fulfilling the requirement of having a Precondition source and an Obligation target. Satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicated elements as all intentional elements are uniquely described. Satisfied.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes a Precondition (IE3: "The required connection and metering points are established") that serves as the source of a Dependency, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency is established from IE3 (Precondition) to IE2 (Obligation). This meets the requirement of having a Precondition source and an Obligation target. Satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements as all intentional elements have unique descriptions. Satisfied.

### Conclusion:
All three choices satisfy the criteria specified. However, upon careful examination, the models differ in their structure and clarity. 

- **Choice 1** is concise and maintains a simple structure without unnecessary verbosity.
- **Choice 2** adds some unnecessary complexity in naming conventions while maintaining clarity.
- **Choice 3** suffers from formatting issues (e.g., the use of commas) that could lead to confusion in interpretation.

Given these observations, the most clear and effective model appears to be **Choice 1**, which adheres to all criteria without introducing complexities.

The best choice is 1.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

- IE2_sub1 is a new sub-goal for "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."

**Step 5: Create contribution links.**

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The model follows the decomposition rule correctly by ensuring that "IE2" (the obligation for customers to have multiple contracts) is decomposed into "IE_B" and "IE_C," which are both obligations and preconditions, respectively. This respects the requirement that decomposition occurs only within the same type and modality.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**: The target of the decomposition (IE2) has more than one intentional element (IE_B and IE_C). This also aligns with the criteria.

Overall, **Choice 1** satisfies both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The model introduces a new proposition "P_IMP_C_B" which captures the implication of the precondition (C) to the action (B). However, it violates the first criterion because it attempts to decompose obligations into an implication which is not the same type and modality as the original obligation. Hence, this decomposition is not valid under the stated rules.

2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**: Although the decomposition targets have more than one element, the violation of the first criterion is significant enough to disqualify this choice.

Overall, **Choice 2** does not satisfy the decomposition criterion.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition of "IE2" into "IE2_sub1" and "IE3" is problematic. "IE2_sub1" is essentially a rephrasing of "IE2" and does not introduce a new element that is distinct. Thus, this violates the first criterion as it doesn't involve a proper decomposition within the same type of intentional elements.

2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition targets more than one element, which might seem to fulfill the second criterion. However, the lack of proper decomposition invalidates this choice.

Overall, **Choice 3** fails to meet the decomposition criterion due to the improper treatment of intentional elements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the three choices in detail, it is clear that **Choice 1** is the only one that fully adheres to both criteria of decomposition between intentional elements of the same type and modality and ensuring that the target of decomposition has more than one intentional element. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition structure is maintained within the same modality and type. The obligations and preconditions are well-defined, with "IE2" being decomposed into sub-goals "IE_B" and "IE_C". This adheres to Criterion 1.
  
2. **Multiple Targets Criterion**: The model has multiple intentional elements (IE_B and IE_C) that correspond to the decomposition of "IE2", thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 1:
This choice effectively models the legal obligations and preconditions while maintaining clear decomposition rules. 

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition of "IE2" is between the intentional elements of the same type and modality. The obligations and preconditions are clearly defined, adhering to Criterion 1.
   
2. **Multiple Targets Criterion**: The model includes multiple intentional elements (specifically, "P_IMP_C_B" for the implication relationship), which means it meets Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 2:
Choice 2 also effectively models the legal requirements with proper decomposition and meets both criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition for "IE2" creates a sub-goal "IE2_sub1" but does not maintain a clear distinction in the decomposition type. This is somewhat ambiguous and does not clarify how preconditions affect the obligations in a structured manner. Thus, it slightly strays from Criterion 1.

2. **Multiple Targets Criterion**: While there is a decomposition to "IE2_sub1", the lack of clarity in how this interacts with the precondition (IE3) raises some concerns about how they are linked. The model does not properly showcase the relationship between the obligation and the necessary conditions in a way that clearly adheres to Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 3:
Choice 3 has structural issues that could lead to misunderstandings regarding the relationships between obligations and preconditions. 

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices based on the criteria provided, the best choice is **Choice 1**. It maintains clarity, adheres to both decomposition criteria effectively, and models the legal obligations and preconditions appropriately. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each of the choices based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**

1. **Criterion 1:** The decomposition is between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. In this choice, the Obligations (IE1 and IE2) and the Precondition (IE3) are correctly categorized. IE2 is decomposed into two elements (IE_B and IE_C), both of which are also of the type Goal but with different modalities. However, the decomposition of IE2 into two components does not satisfy the condition of being of the same type and modality, as they include a mix of Obligations and Preconditions.
   
2. **Criterion 2:** The target of the decomposition (IE2) has more than one Intentional Element (IE_B and IE_C). This criterion is satisfied.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** Due to the violation of Criterion 1, this choice cannot be considered valid.

---

**Choice 2 Analysis:**

1. **Criterion 1:** The decomposition is established between IE2 and its sub-elements (P_IMP_C_B), which is the result of the original obligation being broken down into components based on propositional logic. However, P_IMP_C_B, while logically derived, introduces a conditional link that complicates the modality consistency. The original obligation should remain clear in its intent without introducing implications that were not explicitly stated in the law article.

2. **Criterion 2:** The decomposition also targets more than one Intentional Element (P_IMP_C_B). This criterion is satisfied.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** Despite satisfying Criterion 2, the introduction of P_IMP_C_B complicates the clarity and intent of the original obligations, leading to a potential violation of Criterion 1.

---

**Choice 3 Analysis:**

1. **Criterion 1:** The decomposition is performed correctly, as it maintains the same type and modality. IE2 is decomposed into sub-goals (IE2_sub1) and the precondition (IE3), which is appropriate and maintains the integrity of the model. The original obligations and preconditions are correctly categorized, with a clear distinction between the goals and preconditions.

2. **Criterion 2:** The decomposition targets more than one Intentional Element (IE2_sub1 and IE3). This criterion is satisfied.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice adheres to both criteria, maintaining the integrity of the obligations and preconditions while clearly defining the relationships between them.

---

**Final Conclusion:** The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria and determine which is the best model.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model decomposes the obligation "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time" (IE2) into two sub-intentional elements (IE_B and IE_C). However, both of these are not of the same modality. While IE_B is an obligation, IE_C is a precondition. This violates Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The target of the decomposition (IE2) is correctly linked to more than one intentional element (IE_B and IE_C), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, the obligation IE2 is decomposed into P_IMP_C_B, which is a conditional statement (if-then). This does not align with the original modality of obligation, violating Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition includes multiple intentional elements, meeting Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model proposes a decomposition from IE2 into a sub-goal (IE2_sub1) and includes the required connection and metering points (IE3). Both sub-elements are obligations, which satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - This model also links to more than one intentional element, thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all three choices, Choice 3 is the only one that meets both criteria effectively. It maintains the integrity of the legal obligations and preconditions without violating the decomposition rules. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.
   - In the refinement, the decomposition of IE2 (Obligation) into IE_B (Obligation) and IE_C (Precondition) fails to follow this criterion. The precondition (IE3) is only connected via dependency but should not be part of an obligation decomposition.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE2 into IE_B and IE_C does satisfy this criterion, as it decomposes into two elements.

**Conclusion**: Choice 1 fails on Criterion 1 because it incorrectly mixes modalities in the decomposition.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.
   - Choice 2 correctly maintains that both IE1 and IE2 are obligations and does not mix them with preconditions in a decomposition structure.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - However, the decomposition proposed here does not exist, as it simply maintains a dependency without further decomposition of the obligations.

**Conclusion**: Choice 2 satisfies Criterion 1 but fails to provide a rich model with decomposition, which could enhance the clarity and expressiveness of the model.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.
   - In Choice 3, the decomposition is correctly structured, as it maintains the decomposition of the obligation into sub-goals that are also obligations.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE2 is proposed to lead to IE2_sub1 and IE3. This decomposition is valid as it targets two distinct elements.

**Conclusion**: Choice 3 adheres to both criteria, maintaining clear separation of modalities while providing a valid decomposition structure.

### Final Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices based on the specified criteria, the best choice is **3**. Thus, "The best choice is 3."

Refine Legal GRL model: 

**Step 1: Translate the statements into propositional logic formulas.**

1. **Obligation** O1: Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - Propositional formula: O1
    
2. **Obligation** O2: Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - Propositional formula: O2 and P1, where P1 represents "The required connection and metering points are established."

**Step 2: Build the syntax tree for the second obligation.**

```
    AND
    /

```

**Step 3: Create sub IntentionalElements for each non-root node.**

- O2: Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
- P1: The required connection and metering points are established.

**Step 4: Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions.**

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 To analyze the choices based on the criteria provided, I will evaluate each choice against Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States shall ensure that customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**
   - This statement is atomic and directly reflects the obligation placed on Member States from the perspective of customers.
   
2. **Member States shall ensure that customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.**
   - This statement is atomic and establishes the condition under which customers can have multiple contracts, but it lacks a clear separation of the precondition.

3. **Customers may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**
   - This is an atomic statement about customer rights but is less direct than the first statement, as it shifts from an obligation of Member States to a right of customers.

4. **Customers may have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, if the required connection and metering points are established.**
   - This statement includes a precondition, but it is not framed in the context of Member States' obligations, which is essential for reflecting the legal framework.

**Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: Mostly satisfied, but some statements could be more direct.
- Criterion 2: Partially satisfied, as preconditions are included but not in the best context.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**
   - This statement is atomic and directly corresponds to the obligation of Member States from the perspective of the customers.

2. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**
   - This is also a clear atomic statement reflecting Member States' obligations.

3. **Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.**
   - This statement is atomic and outlines another obligation for Member States, making it clear and relevant.

4. **If the required connection and metering points are established, then customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**
   - This statement clearly delineates the precondition and reflects the conditional nature of the obligation concerning customer rights.

**Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: Fully satisfied, as all statements are clear obligations from Member States to customers.
- Criterion 2: Fully satisfied, as it includes a well-defined precondition.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**
   - This statement is atomic and clearly reflects the obligation of Member States.

2. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**
   - This is another clear atomic statement regarding Member States' obligations.

3. **Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.**
   - This statement is also atomic and relevant.

**Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: Fully satisfied, as all statements reflect obligations.
- Criterion 2: Not satisfied, as there is no explicit mention of a precondition for the contract situation.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the three choices based on the criteria:
- Choice 1 is somewhat satisfactory but lacks clarity in obligations for preconditions.
- Choice 2 excels in both criteria, clearly expressing obligations and preconditions.
- Choice 3 meets the first criterion well but fails on the second.

**The best choice is 2.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the stated criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice extracts atomic statements effectively. The first two statements reflect the obligations of Member States regarding customer freedom, and the last two provide similar information but framed as customer rights.
   - However, the first two statements could lead to ambiguity regarding the requirement of connection and metering points, which is crucial for the second atomic statement.

2. **Preconditions**: 
   - The fourth statement starts with "if," correctly identifying a precondition about the required connection and metering points. This matches the requirement to reflect conditions that would affect the customer's ability to have multiple contracts.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice also extracts atomic statements well. The first two statements reflect the obligations of Member States to customers' rights.
   - The third statement introduces an additional obligation about establishing connection and metering points, which is essential but not explicitly mentioned in the original article as a requirement for the customer but rather as a prerequisite for the Member States.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The fourth statement effectively captures the conditionality of having multiple contracts based on the established connection and metering points. This aligns well with the law article by framing it as a condition.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice extracts atomic statements similar to the previous choices but lacks clarity on the conditions set forth in the law. It does not explicitly mention the relationship between the customer rights and the requirement for connection and metering points.
   - There is no statement addressing the conditional nature of having multiple contracts based on established points, which is a significant omission.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no statements indicating preconditions; therefore, this choice fails to capture the conditional logic required by the law article.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analysis, Choice 1 and Choice 2 both provide a clearer extraction of atomic statements, but Choice 2 does a better job of explicitly stating the requirement for establishing connection and metering points, along with capturing the preconditional logic effectively. Choice 3 fails to capture the necessary preconditions and the relationship between the obligations of Member States and the rights of customers.

The best choice is 2.

   - Statement 2 also captures the obligation about having multiple contracts, but it includes a conditional clause about required connection and metering points.
   - Statement 3 is correct but redundant since the obligation is already stated in Statement 1.
   - Statement 4 correctly expresses the conditional nature of having multiple contracts if specific conditions are met.

**Analysis**:
- Criterion 1: Choice 1 captures atomic statements well but includes redundancy.
- Criterion 2: It partially captures the precondition, but the precondition is mixed with the statement regarding freedom.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Statement 1 captures the obligation of Member States regarding customers' freedom to purchase electricity.
   - Statement 2 repeats the same obligation concerning multiple contracts.
   - Statement 3 introduces a new obligation about the establishment of connection and metering points, which is not correctly framed in the context of a condition.
   - Statement 4 correctly expresses that customers' freedom to have multiple contracts is conditional upon the establishment of connection and metering points.

**Analysis**:
- Criterion 1: Choice 2 effectively extracts atomic statements without redundancy.
- Criterion 2: It clearly states the precondition for having multiple contracts, making it stronger in this aspect.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Statement 1 captures the obligation of Member States regarding customers' choice.
   - Statement 2 captures the obligation regarding multiple contracts.
   - Statement 3 states the obligation about the connection and metering points but lacks the conditional nature required in the law article.

**Analysis**:
- Criterion 1: Choice 3 effectively extracts atomic statements but does not convey the conditionality present in the original law article.
- Criterion 2: It fails to capture the precondition since it does not make the connection between the establishment of points and the condition for multiple contracts.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices based on the criteria, it is clear that Choice 2 best meets the requirements. It effectively extracts atomic statements without redundancy and properly expresses the necessary precondition for the customers to have multiple contracts.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1:**

1. "Member States shall ensure that customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."  
   - This statement captures an atomic legal statement from the perspective of Member States and customers. It directly reflects the obligations of the Member States.
   
2. "Member States shall ensure that customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established."  
   - This statement also captures the obligations of Member States, but the inclusion of "provided that" indicates a conditional clause, which might be better suited for a precondition.

3. "Customers may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."  
   - This statement is not a requirement but rather a permission, which may not be consistent with the legal obligations of Member States in the article.

4. "Customers may have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, if the required connection and metering points are established."  
   - This statement introduces a condition but is phrased as a permission rather than an obligation, which does not align with the legal obligation stated in the directive.

**Choice 2:**

1. "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."  
   - This is a clear and direct atomic statement capturing the obligation from Member States' perspective.

2. "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."  
   - This statement effectively captures another obligation of the Member States but lacks the condition associated with it.

3. "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."  
   - This statement is also valid but does not reflect the conditional aspect of the article, which states that the freedom to have multiple contracts is contingent upon the establishment of the required points.

4. "If the required connection and metering points are established, then customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."  
   - This conditional statement correctly extracts the precondition from the law article, fulfilling the requirement for conditional clauses.

**Choice 3:**

1. "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."  
   - This is a strong atomic statement reflecting the obligations of Member States.

2. "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."  
   - This statement captures another obligation but fails to incorporate the condition regarding the establishment of connection and metering points.

3. "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."  
   - This statement is valid but does not address the conditional nature of the obligations regarding multiple contracts.

**Conclusion:**

Upon analyzing all choices, Choice 2 emerges as the most comprehensive and aligned with the provided criteria. It captures direct obligations of Member States while also successfully extracting the conditional clause regarding customers' ability to have multiple contracts, thus meeting both criteria effectively.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States shall ensure that customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**  
   - This statement accurately captures the requirement from the perspective of Member States and is atomic. It reflects a direct obligation.
   
2. **Member States shall ensure that customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.**  
   - This is also a proper statement, but it combines two ideas: the freedom to have multiple contracts and the condition regarding the connection and metering points. This may not be atomic as it mixes the condition with the action.

3. **Customers may purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**  
   - This statement is atomized, but it does not reflect the obligation placed on Member States, which is a crucial aspect. It diminishes the authority of the Member States in the context.

4. **Customers may have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, if the required connection and metering points are established.**  
   - This statement introduces a conditional clause, but it does not explicitly attribute the responsibility to Member States, which is necessary for a legal model. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**  
   - This is a strong atomic statement reflecting Member States' obligations.

2. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**  
   - Another clear obligation from Member States, but it lacks the condition related to the connection and metering.

3. **Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.**  
   - This is a valid atomic statement that reflects another obligation of Member States.

4. **If the required connection and metering points are established, then customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**  
   - This conditional statement is extracted correctly by identifying the precondition, fulfilling the second criterion.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.**  
   - This statement is strong but does not focus on atomicity since it is not broken down into smaller components.

2. **Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.**  
   - Similar to the first statement, it combines two concepts (freedom and obligation) but lacks the conditional aspect regarding the connection and metering points.

3. **Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.**  
   - This is a valid statement reflecting an obligation but does not cover the customer side of the requirement.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices against the criteria, **Choice 2** stands out as the most comprehensive. It captures the obligations of Member States, and also clearly delineates the precondition for customers to have multiple contracts while ensuring atomicity in the statements. 

The best choice is 2.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria. 

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**: The statements are extracted accurately from the law article. 
2. **Criterion 1**: The description of actions does not include any preconditions.
3. **Criterion 2**: The classification of obligations and permissions is correct:
   - Statements 1, 2, and 3 are obligations for Member States.
   - Statement 4 is a permission for Customers.
4. **Conclusion**: This choice adheres to both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, the statements have been accurately extracted.
2. **Criterion 1**: The actions do not include preconditions, but they are stated in a less clear way, including “None” which is unnecessary in this context.
3. **Criterion 2**: The classification is correct:
   - Statements 1, 2, and 3 are obligations for Member States.
   - Statement 4 indicates a permission for Customers, but it unnecessarily includes a precondition which conflicts with the criteria.
4. **Conclusion**: Though it captures most of the important aspects, the inclusion of preconditions in the last statement violates the model requirements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**: The statements are accurately derived from the law article.
2. **Criterion 1**: The actions are described without preconditions, thus meeting this criterion.
3. **Criterion 2**: The classification is done correctly:
   - Statements 1, 2, and 3 are obligations for Member States.
   - Statement 4 is a permission for Customers, but it includes a precondition which is not acceptable according to the criteria.
4. **Conclusion**: While this choice correctly identifies actions and classifications, the presence of the precondition in the last statement is a significant drawback.

**Final Decision**:
- Choice 1 is the only option that fully complies with both criteria, making it the best choice for generating Legal GRL models from law articles.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Each statement clearly indicates the responsibilities of Member States and the permissions granted to customers. 
   - The last statement introduces a conditional clause ("If the required connection and metering points are established..."), which violates our criteria since it describes a precondition for customer action.

2. **Classification:**
   - The first three statements are obligations for Member States, and the fourth is a permission for customers.
   - However, the fourth statement violates Criterion 1 because it includes a precondition.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - The first three statements are similar to those in Choice 1 and clearly articulate obligations for Member States.
   - The fourth statement also introduces a precondition, stating that customers can only have more than one electricity supply contract if the required connection and metering points are established.

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification indicates the obligations and permissions correctly. However, the fourth statement violates Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of the precondition.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - The first three statements are obligations for Member States, which are clearly articulated without any preconditions.
   - The fourth statement also includes a precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established"), which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification:**
   - All statements are classified correctly, with obligations and permissions clearly outlined. However, the fourth statement violates Criterion 1 due to the precondition.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing all three choices, we can see that they all fail to meet the criteria due to the presence of preconditions in the fourth statement in each choice. However, Choice 1 is the only choice where the fourth statement is a direct consequence of the obligations set out, rather than a separate obligation, which makes it slightly better in terms of clarity. 

Therefore, the best choice is 1, as it maintains a clearer structure of obligations and permissions. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

**Choice 1:**

1. The first three atomic statements do not contain any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1. However, the fourth statement introduces a conditional ("If the required connection and metering points are established"), which violates Criterion 1 as it describes a precondition.
   
2. All atomic statements, except for the fourth, classify obligations appropriately. The fourth statement is classified as a permission but relies on a precondition, which is not acceptable.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** This choice violates Criterion 1 due to the introduction of a precondition in the fourth statement.

---

**Choice 2:**

1. The first three atomic statements do not include preconditions, which satisfies Criterion 1. However, the fourth statement does introduce a precondition ("the required connection and metering points are established") for the permission granted to customers. This violates Criterion 1.

2. In terms of classification, all obligations are accurately represented, but the final statement's classification as a permission is contingent upon a precondition, which does not conform to the requirement for atomic legal statements.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** This choice also violates Criterion 1 due to the fourth statement containing a precondition.

---

**Choice 3:**

1. The first three atomic statements do not contain preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1. However, the fourth statement similarly includes a precondition ("provided that the required connection and metering points are established"), which violates Criterion 1.

2. The classification of obligations and permissions in this choice is appropriate, as the obligations are correctly assigned to Member States, and the permission is assigned to customers. Nonetheless, the presence of a precondition in the last statement undermines the validity of the model.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice fails to meet Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of a precondition in the fourth statement.

---

After analyzing all three choices based on the given criteria, it is clear that all choices have significant issues, primarily concerning the inclusion of preconditions in the atomic legal statements. However, if we consider the clarity and structure of the obligations and permissions presented, **Choice 1** has the cleanest classification of statements without preconditions for the first three statements.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
  4. If the required connection and metering points are established, then customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  
- **Classification:**
  - All three statements (1, 2, 3) are obligations imposed on Member States, while statement 4 is a permission for Customers.
- **Criterion 1:** The actions do not include preconditions.
- **Criterion 2:** All atomic statements are classified correctly as obligations or permissions.

### Choice 2:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
  4. If the required connection and metering points are established, then customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

- **Classification:**
  - The first three are obligations on Member States. The fourth statement permits Customers to have multiple contracts but includes a precondition.
- **Criterion 1:** The actions do not include preconditions for the first three statements.
- **Criterion 2:** There is a misclassification regarding the fourth statement, as it introduces a precondition, violating Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
  4. Customers shall be free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  - The first three statements are obligations on Member States. The fourth statement introduces a permission for Customers but includes a precondition.
- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 2, the actions do not include preconditions for the first three statements but do for the fourth.
- **Criterion 2:** The classification is correct, but the inclusion of a precondition in the fourth statement violates Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, Choice 1 stands out as it adheres to both criteria without introducing any preconditions, and correctly classifies all legal statements as obligations or permissions. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. The first statement correctly identifies an obligation of Member States without including any preconditions.
2. The second statement also follows the same structure and correctly identifies another obligation.
3. The third statement identifies a further obligation but does not specify an action, as it refers to establishing points rather than allowing customers to act.
4. The fourth statement introduces a conditional aspect by linking the permission of customers to a precondition about the establishment of connection and metering points.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: The first three statements are compliant as they do not include preconditions. However, the fourth introduces a conditional aspect.
- Criterion 2: All obligations and permissions are correctly classified.

### Choice 2:
1. The first statement is similar to Choice 1 and correctly identifies an obligation without preconditions.
2. The second statement is also compliant.
3. The third statement identifies an obligation but does not specify an action, which is a concern.
4. The fourth statement includes a precondition for the permission granted to customers.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: The first three statements are compliant, but the last one introduces a precondition.
- Criterion 2: The classifications are correct, but the introduction of preconditions in the last statement is problematic.

### Choice 3:
1. The first statement correctly identifies an obligation of Member States without preconditions.
2. The second statement follows the same structure and identifies another obligation correctly.
3. The third statement also identifies an obligation but lacks an actionable component.
4. The fourth statement again introduces a conditional aspect concerning the permission granted to customers based on the precondition of establishing connection and metering points.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1: The first three statements are compliant, but the fourth introduces a precondition.
- Criterion 2: All obligations and permissions are correctly classified.

### Conclusion:
All choices exhibit similar issues regarding the inclusion of preconditions in their permissions, which is a critical concern. However, Choice 1 presents the obligations clearly without preconditions in the first three statements. The fourth statement is the only one that introduces a precondition, but it does not affect the classification of the previous obligations.

The best choice is **1**.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice against the specified criteria to determine which one best fulfills the requirements for generating Legal GRL models from the law article.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: The model has three intentional elements of type Goal with modality Obligation (IE1, IE2, IE3) and one with modality Permission (IE4). The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a Goal with modality Obligation, satisfying this criterion.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency (IE3) is indeed a Precondition (Goal with modality Obligation), and the targets are either Obligations (IE2) or Permissions (IE4), meeting the requirement.
   
3. **Criterion 3**: No duplication of model elements with the same description is present. All intentional elements have unique descriptions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, there are three intentional elements of type Goal with modality Obligation (IE1, IE2, IE3) and one with modality Permission (IE4). The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a Goal with modality Obligation, so this criterion is satisfied.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a Precondition (Goal with modality Obligation), and the targets are either Obligations (IE2) or Permissions (IE4), which meets the criterion.
   
3. **Criterion 3**: There is no duplication of model elements in this choice as well; all descriptions are unique.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes three Goals with modality Obligation (IE1, IE2, IE3) and one with modality Permission (IE4). The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a Goal with modality Obligation, which satisfies this criterion.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a Precondition (Goal with modality Obligation), and the targets are either Obligations (IE2) or Permissions (IE4), fulfilling the requirements.
   
3. **Criterion 3**: This choice also has no duplication of model elements; all intentional elements have distinct descriptions.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing all three choices against the criteria, it is clear that all three choices technically meet the requirements. However, the structural organization of Choice 1 is clearer and adheres more closely to the specified format without unnecessary complications.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To analyze the three choices of models generated from Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944, we will evaluate them against the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: The model does include a Dependency where the source is IE3 ("ensure that the required connection and metering points are established"), which is a Goal with modality Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The dependencies are correctly set up since the source of the Dependency (IE3) is a «Precondition» (albeit with a slight misnomer since the term "Precondition" is used loosely here; it should refer to the Goal type). The targets are obligations (IE2) and permissions (IE4). Therefore, this satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicated model elements with the same description. Each Intentional Element has a unique description. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: Similar to Choice 1, the model includes a Dependency where the source is IE3, which is a Goal with modality Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The model shows a Dependency from IE3 to both IE2 and IE4 (obligations and permission respectively). Thus, it satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicated model elements, and all Intentional Elements are unique in description. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: Again, the model includes a Dependency where the source is IE3, a Goal with modality Obligation, thus satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The Dependency from IE3 to IE2 is present, but there are no dependencies to IE4, which is a permission. As a result, it fails to fully satisfy Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicated model elements, so this satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- Choices 1 and 2 fully satisfy all criteria.
- Choice 3 fails to satisfy Criterion 2 due to the lack of a Dependency to the permission.

While both Choices 1 and 2 are valid, Choice 2 has a clearer structure and includes all necessary elements in its definitions, including Actor and intentionalElements sections.

Therefore, "The best choice is 2".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria for generating a Legal GRL model from the law article:

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - **IE3** (establishment of connection and metering points) is a Goal with modality Obligation and serves as a source of Dependency.
   - **IE2** and **IE4** are valid targets for these dependencies, satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Dependency Validation**:
   - The dependencies from **IE3** to **IE2** (freedom for multiple contracts) and **IE4** (freedom to have contracts) are valid, as they conform to the requirement that the source is an Obligation and the targets are either Obligations or Permissions.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - No duplication of model elements is present. Each intentional element has a unique description.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This choice adheres to all specified criteria.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, **IE3** serves as a Goal with modality Obligation and is a source of Dependency.
   - Again, **IE2** and **IE4** are valid targets, fulfilling Criterion 2.

2. **Dependency Validation**:
   - The dependencies from **IE3** to **IE2** and **IE4** are appropriate and meet the criteria.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - While the elements are structured differently, they all have unique descriptions, which aligns with the requirement against duplication.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: This choice also meets all the criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - **IE3** continues to serve as a Goal with modality Obligation and is correctly identified as a source for Dependency.
   - The targets **IE2** and **IE4** remain valid.

2. **Dependency Validation**:
   - Dependencies from **IE3** to **IE2** and **IE4** are correctly established and comply with the criteria.

3. **Duplication Check**:
   - The model elements are unique, with no duplicated descriptions.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice adheres to all specified criteria as well.

### Final Decision
All three choices satisfy the criteria outlined, but they differ in formatting and structure. However, based on the clarity and organization of the model, **Choice 1** presents the most straightforward and coherent representation of the dependencies and intentional elements. The structured format is clear and easy to follow.

**The best choice is 1.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis
- **Extracted Atomic Legal Statements**: All statements are accurately extracted from Article 4.
- **Classification**: Each statement is classified correctly as Obligation or Permission.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Intentional Elements (IE1, IE2, IE3 for Member States and IE4 for Customers) are defined with appropriate types and modalities.
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Dependency from IE3 (connection and metering points) to IE2 (freedom to have multiple contracts) aligns with Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.
    - Dependency from IE3 to IE4 also aligns with the criteria.
- **Duplication**: No duplicate descriptions among model elements.
  
### Choice 2 Analysis
- **Extracted Atomic Legal Statements**: Accurate extraction.
- **Classification**: Correct classification.
- **Modeling**: 
  - However, the structure of the model has inconsistencies in indentation and naming conventions (e.g., "Actor" and "IE" syntax).
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - The dependency from IE3 to IE1 is problematic as it does not properly reflect the legal implications (as IE1 is an obligation and does not respond to the conditions set by IE3).
- **Duplication**: No duplicates are present.
  
### Choice 3 Analysis
- **Extracted Atomic Legal Statements**: Accurate extraction.
- **Classification**: Correct classification.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Intentional Elements are clearly defined without any syntactical issues.
  - **Dependencies**: 
    - Dependency from IE3 to IE2 is correct as per the criteria.
    - However, it lacks the dependency from IE3 to IE4, which should also exist to represent the relationship of having multiple contracts based on connection and metering points.
- **Duplication**: No duplicates noted.

### Conclusion
After evaluating all choices against the criteria, we find that:

- **Choice 1** adheres to all criteria strictly, with correct dependencies and no duplication.
- **Choice 2** fails to properly establish a dependency that reflects the legal structure and has inconsistencies in formatting.
- **Choice 3** is structurally sound but misses an important dependency.

Thus, the best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria for generating Legal GRL models from law articles.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: The model has a dependency where IE3 ("ensure that the required connection and metering points are established") is a Goal with modality Obligation. This can serve as a precondition for IE2 and IE4. Thus, it meets Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependencies correctly have a source of a «Precondition» (IE3) connecting to both an «Obligation» (IE2) and a «Permission» (IE4). This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: Each intentional element has a unique description and ID. Hence, there is no duplication, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, the model includes a dependency from IE3 (Obligation) which can act as a precondition. This fulfills Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependencies align as expected, with IE3 being the source for both an «Obligation» (IE2) and a «Permission» (IE4). This meets Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate descriptions or IDs among the intentional elements. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: The model establishes a dependency from IE3 (Obligation) to IE2 (Obligation). However, it does not include a dependency from IE3 to IE4 (Permission), which means it fails to fully utilize the precondition structure. This violates Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: While there is a correct dependency from IE3 to IE2, the absence of a dependency to IE4 indicates a lack of completeness. This violates Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: As in the previous choices, there is no duplication of model elements in terms of description or ID. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analyses, Choices 1 and 2 fulfill all criteria effectively, with both establishing the necessary dependencies and avoiding duplication. However, Choice 1 is clearer and more structured in its representation of dependencies. Choice 3 fails to meet all necessary criteria due to incomplete dependencies.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Member States and Customers.

The model is created using the following domain:
Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944: Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'
    'id:' id=ID
    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?
;

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

EL: Contribution | Decomposition | Dependency;

Contribution: 'Contribution:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
    'level:' level=INT
;

Decomposition: 'Decomposition:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target+=[IE][',']
    'decompositionType:' decompositionType=decompositionType
;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

            target: IE4
```

**Refine Legal GRL model:**  
To refine the Legal GRL model, we will analyze and create the propositional logic formulas based on the obligations and permissions.

1. For Obligation IE1:
   - Propositional logic: Member States must ensure (A)
   - A: ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.

2. For Obligation IE2:
   - Propositional logic: Member States must ensure (B)
   - B: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. For Obligation IE3:
   - Propositional logic: Member States must ensure (C)
   - C: ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

4. For Permission IE4:
   - Propositional logic: Customers are free (D)
   - D: have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

Since Obligation IE3 is a prerequisite for both IE2 and IE4, we will create the syntax tree for the dependencies based on the implications derived from the article.

### Syntax Tree:
```
      AND
      /   \
   C       B
          |
          D
```

### Intentional Elements
- **IE1**: ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice (Obligation)
- **IE2**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time (Obligation)
- **IE3**: ensure that the required connection and metering points are established (Obligation)
- **IE4**: have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time (Permission)
- **IE_B**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time (Obligation, derived from IE2)
- **IE_D**: have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time (Permission, derived from IE4)
- **IE_AND_C_B**: Customers shall have more than one electricity supply contract if the required connection and metering points are established (Goal, derived from the combination of IE3, IE2, and IE4)

In this refined model, I have included additional preconditions that clarify the dependencies and ensure that the relationships between the obligations and permissions are logically structured according to the original article. Each element is clearly defined to reflect its legal significance and relationships with others.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 To assess the three choices for generating Legal GRL models from the provided law article, I will analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**: 
   - The model adheres to the decomposition criterion, as all intentional elements of the same type (obligations and permissions) are decomposed appropriately. 
   - Preconditions are distinctly separated and only relate to other preconditions.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model correctly identifies multiple intentional elements in the dependencies, especially with the connection and metering points established as a prerequisite for both the permission and obligation regarding multiple contracts.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**: 
   - Choice 2 also follows the decomposition criterion correctly, with all intentional elements categorized according to their modality.
   - The obligations and permissions are decomposed without any violation of the criterion.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The dependencies show that the actions of the Member States lead to multiple outcomes for customers, satisfying the requirement of having more than one intentional element as targets.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - The model in this choice fails to adhere strictly to the decomposition criterion due to the introduction of new intentional elements that do not necessarily correspond to the original modalities or types set forth in the directives.
   - The introduction of multiple preconditions for the same obligations muddles the clear separation required by the decomposition criterion.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model attempts to create dependencies and decompositions but introduces unnecessary complexity. The decomposition of IE2 into IE4 and the further decomposition of IE4 into IE6 does not align with the original law's intent and introduces excessive granularity.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing each choice, it is clear that Choice 1 and Choice 2 both effectively meet the criteria outlined, while Choice 3 introduces complexity that detracts from clarity and adherence to the decomposition criteria. However, Choice 1 presents a more straightforward and less convoluted representation of the legal requirements.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction**: The extraction is correct and captures the key obligations of Member States and the permissions of Customers.
- **Classification of Intentional Elements**: All statements are classified correctly into Obligations and Permissions.
- **Decomposition**: Although the decomposition is primarily based on dependencies, it does not separate Intentional Elements by modality. For example, the decomposition of a precondition is not explicitly shown as a separate type.
- **Target of Decomposition**: The model attempts to establish dependencies, but it lacks clear decomposition between different modalities and types.
- **Criterion 1 Violation**: The model does not enforce the rule that decompositions can only happen within the same modality, particularly where preconditions are concerned.
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The element links are somewhat valid; however, they do not clearly involve more than one Intentional Element in the decomposition aspect.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- Similar to Choice 1, the extraction and classification of legal statements are accurate.
- **Decomposition**: The model does not clearly establish decompositions that are purely based on the same type and modality, as there is no clear delineation of preconditions versus obligations.
- **Target of Decomposition**: This model also struggles with the requirement for more than one Intentional Element in decomposition.
- **Criterion 1 Violation**: Decompositions across modalities are not respected. The dependencies created do not show a clear separation of types.
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: There are some valid dependencies, but they are not well-structured in terms of decomposing multiple Intentional Elements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- The extraction of atomic legal statements is correctly represented.
- **Classification of Intentional Elements**: The obligations and permissions are well-defined.
- **Decomposition**: This model introduces additional preconditions, but it does not maintain a clear distinction between different modalities. The decomposition of permissions and preconditions is still not clearly defined.
- **Target of Decomposition**: While attempts are made to show dependencies, it does not effectively decompose into multiple Intentional Elements particularly when considering the same modality.
- **Criterion 1 Violation**: There are issues with how preconditions and obligations are intermingled without maintaining a strict modality.
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: Similar to the previous choices, it does not fulfill the requirement of clearly decomposing into multiple Intentional Elements.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the choices, all three present issues primarily regarding the violation of Criterion 1. They do not adequately enforce the rule that decomposition must occur within the same type and modality. Additionally, the decomposition targets do not effectively reflect multiple Intentional Elements.

However, Choice 3 provides a more nuanced structure with additional preconditions and clearer links between obligations and permissions compared to Choices 1 and 2, despite still lacking in fully adhering to the criteria. 

Thus, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1:
1. **Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality:**
   - The model correctly separates obligations (IE1, IE2, IE3) from permission (IE4) and preconditions (C1). Therefore, it adheres to the decomposition criterion.
   
2. **The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element:**
   - There are dependencies where the source (IE3) targets multiple elements (IE2 and IE4). This also adheres to the criteria.

### Choice 2:
1. **Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality:**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the model maintains separation between obligations and permissions, adhering to the decomposition criterion.

2. **The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element:**
   - While the dependencies are present, there is a lack of multiple intentional elements in the decomposition, as it only links to two elements directly without multiple targets from the same source.

### Choice 3:
1. **Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality:**
   - This choice also maintains the separation of obligations from permissions and preconditions. Therefore, it adheres to the decomposition criterion.

2. **The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element:**
   - The decomposition section appears to incorrectly focus on single elements rather than multiple as it refers to new preconditions without a clear structure of multiple targets.

### Conclusion:
Comparing all three choices, **Choice 1** is the strongest candidate as it fully satisfies both criteria regarding decomposition and the nature of dependencies and intentional elements. It clearly captures the legal requirements and relationships without introducing unnecessary complexity or misalignments in the intentional elements.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 In analyzing the three choices for generating Legal GRL models from the specified law article, we need to evaluate them against the established criteria. 

### Choice 1 Analysis:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is complete and accurately reflects the obligations of Member States and the permissions granted to customers. 

**Classification**: Each statement is classified correctly according to the actors, modalities, and actions. 

**Model and Element Links**: The model demonstrates clear dependencies between obligations and permissions. However, it lacks a clear representation of the preconditions that must be established for the permissions to be effective. 

**Refinement**: The refinement process correctly identifies obligations and permissions, but it does not sufficiently address the preconditions needed for the permissions to take effect. 

**Criterion 1**: Satisfied as elements of the same type and modality are grouped accordingly.
**Criterion 2**: Not fully satisfied; there are decompositions of single intentional elements, and the preconditions are not effectively represented.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice accurately reflects the original article's statements. 

**Classification**: Similar to Choice 1, the classification is done correctly.

**Model and Element Links**: The model seems straightforward, with obligations clearly linked to permissions. 

**Refinement**: The refinement introduces new intentional elements but does not clarify how they relate to the preconditions necessary for the permissions. 

**Criterion 1**: Satisfied as intentional elements are categorized correctly.
**Criterion 2**: Not fully satisfied due to lack of explicit decomposition into multiple intentional elements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction remains consistent with the original article’s intent.

**Classification**: Correctly categorizes all elements, including a new focus on preconditions.

**Model and Element Links**: The structure here is more complex, incorporating additional preconditions and decompositions that clarify their relationships.

**Refinement**: This choice introduces the most robust representation of dependencies and preconditions. It effectively captures the relationships between obligations, permissions, and the necessary preconditions.

**Criterion 1**: Satisfied as it maintains the correct modality within the classifications.
**Criterion 2**: Satisfied with the introduction of additional intentional elements and preconditions, allowing for a clearer depiction of interdependencies.

### Conclusion:
Considering the detailed evaluations based on the criteria, Choice 3 stands out as the best option. It effectively decomposes the law article’s components into intentional elements, maintains clear relationships among them, and addresses the necessary preconditions that must be satisfied for permissions to be exercised.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
- The model extracts and classifies legal statements effectively, capturing the obligations of Member States and the permissions granted to customers.
- The decomposition of obligations into intentional elements adheres to Criterion 1, as all decomposed elements are of the same type (Obligation).
- However, the model does not meet Criterion 2, as the decomposition of obligations is not structured to show more than one intentional element. The dependencies do not indicate a clear relationship that requires multiple elements to be satisfied for an outcome.
- Additionally, the dependency relationship between the established connection and permissions could be more clearly articulated.

**Choice 2:**
- This choice also extracts and classifies legal statements accurately.
- It maintains compliance with Criterion 1, keeping obligations and permissions separate.
- The model introduces a syntax tree which indicates the logical structure of dependencies, yet it still lacks a clear representation of multiple intentional elements being necessary for the outcome, which fails to meet Criterion 2.
- The relationships between intentions could be further clarified to enhance understanding of how they interrelate.

**Choice 3:**
- This choice similarly extracts and classifies legal statements correctly.
- It adheres to Criterion 1 by ensuring all elements are appropriately categorized.
- However, like the previous choices, it struggles with Criterion 2, failing to clearly represent that the outcomes depend on multiple intentional elements.
- The introduction of new preconditions adds complexity but does not necessarily clarify the relationships among obligations and permissions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices, none fully meet both criteria, particularly Criterion 2, which is essential for capturing the interdependencies among multiple intentional elements. However, **Choice 1** stands out as the most structured model in terms of clear obligations and permissions, despite lacking in the decomposition of multiple elements. Therefore, the best choice is **1**.
