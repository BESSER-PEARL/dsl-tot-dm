Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail with respect to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must create a research plan in writing."
   - "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."

**Analysis**: 
- This choice successfully extracts atomic statements from the law article, clearly outlining the requirements for researchers. 
- The use of "must" indicates obligatory actions, which aligns with the legal nature of the statements. 
- However, there is no mention of any conditions or preconditions that might apply to these actions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing."
   - "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."

**Analysis**: 
- Similar to Choice 1, this choice extracts clear atomic statements from the law article.
- The wording "prepare" and "indicate" offers slight variations in tone but does not alter the fundamental meaning.
- Like Choice 1, this choice lacks any conditional clauses or preconditions that start with "if."

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must have a written research plan."
   - "Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research."
   - "Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research."
   - "Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate."
   - "Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research."

**Analysis**: 
- This choice also successfully extracts atomic statements, but the phrasing is slightly varied (e.g., "have a written research plan" vs. "create a research plan in writing").
- It maintains clarity and adheres to legal framing.
- Once again, this choice does not address any conditional statements or preconditions.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the three choices, all options effectively extract atomic legal statements from the law article. However, none of the options include any preconditions that are necessary for clauses starting with "if," which is a significant oversight.

In terms of clarity and legal accuracy, all choices are relatively equal. However, Choice 2 stands out slightly due to the use of "prepare" and "indicate," which might be seen as more aligned with typical legal language.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the choices in the context of generating Legal GRL models from law articles for researchers, we will analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** The statements clearly indicate what is required from the researchers, maintaining a focus on each individual requirement. Each statement is action-oriented and specifies what researchers must do regarding their research plan.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** There are no conditional clauses starting with "if" in the domain description, so this criterion is not applicable here. However, the structure allows for easy identification of obligations.

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** Similar to Choice 1, this choice also effectively presents the required actions for researchers. The terminology "prepare" and "indicate" provides a slightly different nuance than "create" and "outline," but retains the clarity of obligations.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** Again, no conditional clauses are present, so this criterion does not apply, but the clarity remains high.

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** This choice uses different verbs such as "have," "set out," "define," and "articulate." While these verbs convey similar meanings, they introduce a different tone. For example, "have" may imply possession rather than a proactive requirement, which could lead to ambiguity regarding the obligation to create the plan.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** As with the previous choices, there are no conditional clauses, making this analysis irrelevant here.

**Conclusion:**
All choices effectively extract atomic statements from the law article. However, Choices 1 and 2 maintain a more direct and action-oriented language that clearly delineates the researchers' obligations, which aligns better with the requirement for generating Legal GRL models. Between these two, Choice 1 uses "create" and "outline," which might better emphasize the active role of researchers in the process. Choice 2's use of "prepare" and "indicate" also works well but is slightly less emphatic.

Thus, the best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1:**
1. Researchers must create a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are atomic and extracted from the law article appropriately.
- Criterion 2: There are no clauses starting with "if" in the provided law article, making this criterion not applicable.

**Choice 2:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan.
5. Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are clear, atomic, and accurately reflect the requirements from the law article.
- Criterion 2: Similar to Choice 1, there are no "if" clauses present in the law article.

**Choice 3:**
1. Researchers must have a written research plan.
2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
3. Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.
4. Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are atomic and extracted correctly from the law article.
- Criterion 2: Again, there are no "if" clauses in the law article.

**Conclusion:**
All three choices effectively meet Criterion 1 by providing atomic statements that reflect the requirements of the research plan as outlined in the law article. Criterion 2 is not applicable in any case as there are no conditional clauses ("if"). However, the phrasing of the atomic statements varies slightly among the choices.

Choice 1 uses "create," which implies initiation, whereas Choice 2 uses "prepare," which may suggest a more formalized process. Choice 3 uses "have," which may lack the emphasis on the structured nature of the plan. The terms in Choice 2 ("prepare," "describe," and "indicate") are more aligned with formal documentation processes which researchers are likely to engage in, thus providing a clearer, more standardized understanding of the requirements.

Considering all of these factors, "The best choice is 2."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**  
   - This is a clear and direct statement reflecting the requirement for a written document.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**  
   - This captures the requirement for listing affiliations, which is an atomic statement.

3. **Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**  
   - This accurately reflects the need to clarify the nature and objectives of the research.

4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**  
   - This captures the expectation of stating benefits, but the word "outline" could be less precise than "specify."

5. **Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**  
   - This statement is suitable for capturing the requirement for additional matters.

**Analysis:** The wording is mostly clear and direct, but the use of "outline" could be seen as slightly less precise than "specify."

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**  
   - "Prepare" is a suitable term, similar to "create," and captures the requirement well.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and captures the requirement effectively.

3. **Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**  
   - "Describe" is appropriate and conveys a clear requirement.

4. **Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan.**  
   - "Indicate" is less strong than "specify," which could lead to ambiguity in what is required.

5. **Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**  
   - This is the same as Choice 1 and effectively captures the requirement.

**Analysis:** While this choice is mostly clear, the use of "indicate" may create ambiguity regarding the level of detail required.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must have a written research plan.**  
   - "Have" is less definitive than "create" or "prepare," which could imply a lack of proactive engagement.

2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**  
   - "Set out" is a strong phrase but could be more specific in context compared to "include."

3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.**  
   - "Define" is a strong term, clearly indicating the need for clarity in objectives.

4. **Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**  
   - "Articulate" is a good choice, demanding a clear expression of anticipated benefits.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**  
   - This is consistent with previous choices and captures the requirement effectively.

**Analysis:** While this choice uses some strong verbs, the term "have" is weaker than the other choices, making it less suitable.

### Conclusion:
After detailed analysis based on the criteria, **Choice 1** provides the most precise and clear extraction of atomic statements from the law article, while effectively addressing the preconditions required for researchers. The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must create a research plan in writing."  
   - This statement is clear and directly reflects the requirement of having a written research plan.  

2. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."  
   - This captures the requirement to document affiliations, satisfying Criterion 1.

   - This aligns with the requirement to cover all other necessary aspects, satisfying Criterion 1.  

Overall, Choice 1 meets both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing."  
   - Similar to Choice 1, it states the requirement for a written plan but uses "prepare" instead of "create."  

2. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and satisfies Criterion 1.  

3. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."  
   - The term "describe" is slightly less specific than "specify," but it still conveys the same meaning.  

4. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan."  
   - "Indicate" may also be seen as less strong than "outline," but still meets the criterion.  

5. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and satisfies Criterion 1.  

Overall, Choice 2 also meets both criteria effectively, though some wording is less precise.

All three choices successfully meet both criteria. However, there are no significant differences in the quality or adherence to the criteria among them. Each choice presents the same content and structure, meaning they are nearly identical in their effectiveness.

Since all choices are valid, I conclude that the best choice is **1** based on the order of presentation, but it can be said that all choices are equally valid. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
- The choice effectively extracts atomic legal statements related to the obligations of researchers:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives of the research.
  4. Outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit.
  5. Address all other prescribed matters related to the research.

- **Criterion 1:** The actions described do not include preconditions, satisfying this criterion.
- **Criterion 2:** Each statement is classified as an obligation, which is appropriate as all actions are required by the researchers.

### Choice 2:
- This choice is similar to Choice 1 in that it extracts the same atomic legal statements and classifies them.
- The format is slightly different, but the essence remains unchanged:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives.
  4. Outline the anticipated benefits.
  5. Address prescribed matters.

- **Criterion 1:** Again, there are no preconditions included in the action descriptions.
- **Criterion 2:** All actions are classified as obligations, which is consistent with the requirements.

### Choice 3:
- Choice 3 also extracts the same statements and follows a similar classification process.
- The structure remains consistent with the previous choices, detailing:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives.
  4. Outline the anticipated benefits.
  5. Address prescribed matters.

- **Criterion 1:** There are no preconditions cited in the action descriptions.
- **Criterion 2:** The classification of all actions as obligations is correct.

### Conclusion:
All three choices effectively extract and classify the legal statements. They all satisfy both criteria, but they differ mainly in formatting. Since there's no significant difference in the content or fulfillment of the criteria, any choice would be equally valid. However, if a preference for conciseness or clarity in presentation is desired, one might lean towards Choice 1 for its straightforward listing.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** The extraction is clear and accurately represents the obligations of the researchers based on the law article.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is categorized with the correct actor (Researchers), modal verb (must), modality (Obligation), and action(s). 
- **Precondition(s):** It explicitly states that there are no preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are classified correctly as obligations, in line with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** Similar to Choice 1, the extraction is accurate and comprehensive.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is formatted clearly with the necessary classifications. 
- **Precondition(s):** It also states that there are no preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** The extraction remains consistent with the previous choices, accurately capturing the obligations.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is clearly outlined with the appropriate classifications. 
- **Precondition(s):** It states there are no preconditions, meeting Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are correctly classified as obligations, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
All three choices successfully extract and classify the legal obligations of researchers as mandated by the law article. However, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are identical in their content and adherence to the criteria. Therefore, since they perform equally in the analysis, I will select the first choice as the best representation.

The best choice is 1.

Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "Researchers"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE1"
                description: "Create a research plan in writing"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:

            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE4"

                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:

;

EL: Dependency:
    source: IE1
    target: IE1
    // No preconditions for IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5 as well
```

**Note:** In the above model, each obligation represents a separate goal without preconditions; therefore, no dependencies are established since there are no preconditions to link them to. If any of the statements had specified preconditions, they would have been included as separate IntentionalElements with corresponding Dependency relationships.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: There are no dependencies established from a «Precondition». All obligations (IE1 to IE5) are independent goals without preconditions.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: Again, there are no dependencies where a «Precondition» is the source, as there are no preconditions defined in this model.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements since all obligations are distinct.

**Conclusion**: This choice fails to meet both Criteria 1 and 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no dependencies established from a «Precondition». Each obligation is treated independently without any preconditions.

2. **Criterion 2**: There are no dependencies with a «Precondition» as the source.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements.

**Conclusion**: This choice also fails to meet both Criteria 1 and 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: This choice introduces a clear «Precondition» (IE6: "The research plan must exist"), which serves as the source of dependencies for obligations (IE1 to IE5). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2**: The dependencies are correctly established, with the «Precondition» (IE6) being the source and the target being the various obligations (IE1 to IE5). This satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements, as all goals are distinct.

**Conclusion**: This choice meets all three criteria, making it the best option.

Given this analysis, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: The model does not establish any preconditions for the obligations (Goals) related to the research plan. As a result, there are no dependencies created as the source of a dependency must be a precondition, which is absent here.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: All actions listed are classified as obligations; however, none of them are linked to a precondition.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate model elements since each goal is described uniquely.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** This choice fails to establish necessary dependencies as it lacks preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, this model does not establish any preconditions. As a result, each obligation is self-referential, which does not satisfy the requirement of dependencies.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: The elements are correctly categorized as obligations.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate elements.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** This choice also fails to establish necessary dependencies due to the absence of preconditions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: This model introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist." This precondition is linked to all subsequent obligations (Goals) regarding the research plan, fulfilling the criteria for a source of dependency.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: All actions are categorized as obligations, and they depend on the existence of the research plan.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicates since each element has a unique description.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice meets all criteria. It establishes a clear precondition that is linked to the obligations, thus creating the necessary dependencies.

After analyzing all choices based on the given criteria, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: No preconditions are specified for any of the obligations. Thus, there are no sources for Dependencies that meet the criterion of being a Precondition.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: There are no valid Dependencies established because the sources of Dependencies are not Preconditions, violating Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicate descriptions among the IntentionalElements.

Overall, this choice does not meet the criteria for establishing Dependencies due to the lack of Precondition elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice lacks any Precondition elements. There are no sources for Dependencies that qualify as Preconditions.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: The established Dependencies all point back to the same goal (self-dependency), which does not fulfill the requirement of having a source as a Precondition and a target as an Obligation or Permission.

3. **Duplication Check**: No duplicates are present among the IntentionalElements.

This choice also does not satisfy the criteria for establishing valid Dependencies due to the absence of Precondition elements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: This choice includes a Precondition: "The research plan must exist." This serves as a valid source for Dependencies.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: The Dependencies are established from the Precondition to each of the obligations, fulfilling the requirements of Criterion 2. Each obligation regarding the research plan is dependent on the existence of the research plan, which is valid.

3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates in the descriptions of IntentionalElements.

This choice successfully meets all criteria for model validity, establishing the necessary Dependencies and ensuring no duplication.

### Conclusion:

After a thorough analysis of each choice against the defined criteria, it is clear that the only choice that fulfills all conditions is Choice 3. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail in light of the criteria provided.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
- The model extracts obligations but does not establish any dependencies because there are no preconditions identified. 
- As per Criterion 1, there is no «Precondition» that serves as the source of a Dependency.
- Criterion 2 is not met either, as there are no dependencies established between a «Precondition» and an «Obligation» or «Permission».
- Criterion 3 is satisfied as there are no duplications in the descriptions of the model elements.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** This choice does not fulfill the necessary criteria, especially regarding dependencies.

---

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
- Similar to Choice 1, this choice also extracts obligations, but again fails to establish valid dependencies.
- Criterion 1 is not satisfied because no «Precondition» is present as a source of a Dependency.
- Criterion 2 remains unmet for the same reason; there are no connections between «Precondition» and «Obligation».
- Criterion 3 is satisfied since there are no duplicate descriptions.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** This choice also fails to meet the dependency criteria.

---

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
- This choice extracts obligations and introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist."
- Criterion 1 is satisfied as the precondition (IE6) serves as the source for dependencies.
- Criterion 2 is also satisfied as the dependencies link the precondition (IE6) to the obligations (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5).
- Criterion 3 is satisfied as there are no duplicate descriptions, and all elements have unique identifiers.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice fully meets all the criteria, establishing valid dependencies based on a precondition and maintaining uniqueness in model elements.

---

After careful analysis, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: No intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition is included as the source of any Dependency. Thus, the Dependency relationships cannot be established.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The lack of a Precondition means that the source of the Dependency does not meet the requirement to link an obligation or permission.
3. **Duplication Check**: The model contains no duplication of elements. Each goal statement is unique.

### Conclusion for Choice 1
Choice 1 fails to meet both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2. Thus, it cannot be deemed a valid model.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, there is no intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition included as a source for any Dependency.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The self-referential Dependencies do not establish meaningful relationships since they do not involve a valid Precondition.
3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates; all goals are stated distinctly.

### Conclusion for Choice 2
Choice 2 also fails to meet Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, rendering it an invalid model.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: This choice introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist," which is a Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The Dependencies are established correctly, as the source of each Dependency (the precondition) is linked to the respective obligations (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5, IE1). This meets the criteria that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be either an Obligation or Permission.
3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates present; all elements are unique.

### Conclusion for Choice 3
Choice 3 meets all criteria effectively, establishing proper dependencies and ensuring that there are no duplications. 

The best choice is **3**.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 ### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:
In this choice, the model effectively captures the obligations and dependencies related to the creation of a research plan by researchers. The intentional elements are all categorized correctly as "Obligations," and the precondition indicating that "The research plan must exist" is clearly linked to all other obligations. 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: The decomposition of obligations and preconditions adheres to the requirement that only elements of the same type and modality are decomposed. All intentional elements are categorized under the "Obligation" modality.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The model satisfies this criterion as the target of the decomposition (IE6) is linked to multiple obligations (IE1 through IE5), ensuring that the precondition is relevant to more than one intentional element.

#### Choice 2:
Choice 2 presents a similar structure but introduces additional intentional elements (IE7 and IE8) that also serve as preconditions. 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: This model maintains the correct decomposition of intentional elements, as all obligations are classified under "Obligation" and preconditions under "Precondition." However, the introduction of multiple preconditions may unnecessarily complicate the model.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The model still fulfills this criterion, with preconditions being relevant to multiple obligations. However, the addition of unnecessary preconditions could detract from clarity.

#### Choice 3:
Choice 3 closely mirrors Choice 1 but includes a redundant precondition (IE7). 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: The classification of intentional elements remains intact, adhering to the same modality across obligations and preconditions.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: This choice also maintains compliance with the criterion as preconditions are linked to multiple obligations. However, the redundancy noted in the additional precondition suggests an inefficiency.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the choices based on the specific criteria for the domain modeling of legal GRL models from law articles, it is clear that while all choices have their merits, Choice 1 stands out as the most efficient and clear representation of the obligations and dependencies without unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the three choices for creating a Legal GRL model based on the provided legal requirements for researchers in the domain of writing research plans, we will analyze each choice against the stated criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: The model adheres to Criterion 1, as all intentional elements are obligations and preconditions that are appropriately grouped. Each obligation is linked only to its relevant precondition.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied, as each precondition connects to multiple obligations, ensuring the target of the decomposition is more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: This choice also respects Criterion 1 by maintaining the decomposition within the same modality types (obligations and preconditions). The model reflects a clear structure of obligations and the necessary precondition for the existence of the research plan.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is met as well, with each precondition linking to multiple obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: This choice follows Criterion 1 strictly, ensuring that all intentional elements maintain their respective modalities. The obligations are clearly defined, and the precondition is correctly positioned.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is satisfied through the connections between the precondition and multiple obligations.

### Conclusion:
All three choices effectively meet both criteria. However, there are differences in their complexity and clarity. 

- **Choice 1** is the most straightforward and clear, with a simple model structure that doesn’t introduce unnecessary additional elements. 
- **Choice 2** introduces an additional precondition but maintains clarity in its intent.
- **Choice 3** adds complexity without significant benefit, making it less preferable.

Given the analysis, while all models are valid, the simplest and clearest structure is found in **Choice 1**.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: All intentional elements are obligations and are decomposed appropriately:
  - The model correctly identifies and links the precondition "The research plan must exist" (IE6) to the obligations that depend on it (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5). This satisfies Criterion 1.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: The model includes one precondition (IE6) that targets multiple obligations (IE1-IE5), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, all intentional elements are of the same type (obligations), and the decomposition correctly links the precondition to the obligations.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: The model also targets multiple obligations from a single precondition (IE6), thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: This choice also maintains the same structure as the first two, with all intentional elements being obligations. The precondition links are appropriate.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: It effectively utilizes the precondition (IE6) to target multiple obligations (IE1-IE5), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion
All three choices effectively meet both criteria regarding decomposition and the targets of decomposition. However, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 have a streamlined approach without the redundancy seen in Choice 3, where there are extra intentional elements that repeat the same obligation regarding the existence of the research plan.

Between Choices 1 and 2, both are essentially equivalent in structure and fulfillment of requirements. However, Choice 1 presents a clearer and more concise model without repetitive intentional elements, making it easier to understand and more in line for implementation.

Thus, the best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the three choices of domain modeling for generating Legal GRL models from law articles from the perspective of researchers, we will analyze each option based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: This model adheres to Criterion 1 by only decomposing Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. All obligations are categorized under the modality of "Obligation" and "Precondition" is treated separately.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is satisfied as the decomposed elements (IE2 to IE5) all depend on the existence of the research plan (IE6).
- **Overall Structure**: This model effectively links obligations to the required preconditions and provides a clear representation of the relationships between the elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: Like Choice 1, this model correctly maintains the decomposition rules as per Criterion 1. All intentional elements are obligations or preconditions, and none are inappropriately mixed.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied, as the dependencies are clear and linked to the precondition of the research plan's existence.
- **Additional Elements**: This model introduces additional preconditions (IE7 and IE8) that add complexity. However, it does not enhance clarity regarding the obligations, making the model somewhat convoluted.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: Criterion 1 is adhered to, as it follows the same structure as the previous choices by ensuring that decomposition is only amongst similar modalities.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied without issue. The linkages to the preconditions are clear and logically structured.
- **Redundancy**: This model includes redundant preconditions (IE6 and IE7), which do not contribute additional value to the clarity of the model. This could lead to confusion regarding the necessity of each condition.

### Conclusion:
While all three models adhere to the criteria, Choice 1 stands out for its clarity and simplicity. It effectively captures the required obligations without introducing unnecessary complexity or redundancy, which is crucial for researchers who will be using the model to generate legal GRL models.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Analyzing the three choices based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - The model correctly decomposes obligations (IE1 to IE5) into individual obligations with a precondition (IE6) that "The research plan must exist." This follows Criterion 1 as all decompositions are between the same type (Obligations) and modality.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The model has multiple dependencies from the precondition (IE6) to the obligations (IE1 to IE5). This meets Criterion 2 as at least one intentional element is targeted (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5, IE1).
- **Overall Structure**: 
    - The model is well-structured and maintains clarity in the obligations and dependencies.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also decomposes the obligations correctly. It maintains the same type and modality among the intentional elements.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The precondition (IE6) links to multiple obligations (IE1 to IE5), meeting Criterion 2 effectively.
- **Additional Elements**: 
    - This choice introduces unnecessary duplication of preconditions (IE7 and IE8), which could complicate the model and does not add value.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - The structure follows the same pattern as Choices 1 and 2 with correct decomposition.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The model's dependencies from IE6 to various obligations remain intact, fulfilling Criterion 2.
- **Clarity**: 
    - However, like Choice 2, this choice introduces redundancy with repeated precondition statements (IE7). 

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluation, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 correctly follow the decomposition rules and target multiple intentional elements. However, Choice 1 is the most concise and avoids redundancy present in Choices 2 and 3, making it clearer and easier to understand.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."

Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 To analyze the choices against the specified criteria, we will examine how each choice extracts the atomic statements from the law article and identifies any preconditions associated with clauses starting with "if".

**Choice 1:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must state the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

**Analysis for Choice 1:**
- **Criterion 1**: All statements are atomic and clearly articulated from the perspective of researchers. Each statement reflects a specific requirement from the law article.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no clauses that begin with "if" in the law article, so this criterion is not applicable.

**Choice 2:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.  
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.  
3. Researchers must outline the nature and objectives of the research and the anticipated public or scientific benefit in the research plan.  
4. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.  

**Analysis for Choice 2:**
- **Criterion 1**: The first two statements are atomic and clear. However, the third statement combines two concepts (nature and objectives of the research with anticipated benefits) into one statement, which dilutes the atomicity.
- **Criterion 2**: Like Choice 1, there are no "if" clauses, so this criterion is also not applicable.

**Choice 3:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

**Analysis for Choice 3:**
- **Criterion 1**: All statements are atomic and maintain clarity. Each requirement is distinctly addressed, ensuring that the focal actor's perspective is well-represented.
- **Criterion 2**: Similar to the previous choices, there are no "if" clauses present in the law article.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all three choices, it's clear that while all choices fulfill Criterion 1 to some extent, Choice 1 is the most effective as it maintains the atomicity of each statement without combining concepts. Choice 2 loses atomicity by merging two distinct requirements into one statement, and while Choice 3 does retain atomicity, it doesn't surpass the clarity and straightforwardness of Choice 1.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**
   - This statement captures the requirement clearly and relates directly to the focal actors (Researchers).
   
2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**
   - This statement accurately reflects the requirement of including affiliations, directly relevant to Researchers.
   
3. **Researchers must state the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**
   - This statement captures the essence of what is required about the nature and objectives, but the wording "state" could be considered less specific than "articulate" or "outline".
   
4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**
   - This is a clear and direct requirement, addressing the anticipated benefits.
   
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**
   - This is a broad statement that covers all other necessary elements, fulfilling the requirement.

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**
   - This is a clear statement, as in Choice 1.
   
2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**
   - This is also clear and direct.
   
3. **Researchers must outline the nature and objectives of the research and the anticipated public or scientific benefit in the research plan.**
   - This combines the nature/objectives and benefits into one statement, which may lead to a slight loss of clarity about the distinct requirements.
   
4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**
   - This remains clear and covers all other elements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**
   - As in previous choices, this is clear and direct.
   
2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**
   - This is clear and consistent with the requirements.
   
3. **Researchers must articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**
   - The use of "articulate" here adds specificity to the requirement, which is beneficial.
   
4. **Researchers must describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**
   - Similar to Choice 1, this separates the benefits from the nature/objectives, providing clarity.
   
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**
   - This is also clear and comprehensive.

### Conclusion:
- **Criterion 1**: All choices successfully extract atomic statements from the law article from the perspective of Researchers, but Choice 3 does so with better specificity in wording.
- **Criterion 2**: None of the choices contain clauses that start with "if," so the precondition requirement is not applicable here. 

Given the clarity and specificity of the atomic statements in Choice 3, it provides a more comprehensive and precise model for the focal actors, Researchers.

The best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To determine which choice best models the domain of generating Legal GRL models from law articles from the perspective of researchers, I'll evaluate each choice against the given criteria.

**Choice 1:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must state the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

- **Criterion 1:** This choice extracts atomic statements effectively and clearly from the law article. Each statement captures distinct obligations of researchers.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no clauses that begin with "if," so there are no applicable preconditions to extract.

**Choice 2:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.  
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.  
3. Researchers must outline the nature and objectives of the research and the anticipated public or scientific benefit in the research plan.  
4. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.  

- **Criterion 1:** This choice combines two elements into one statement (nature and objectives of the research and anticipated public or scientific benefit), which somewhat dilutes the atomicity of the statements. This makes it less clear and less precise.
- **Criterion 2:** Similar to Choice 1, there are no clauses that begin with "if."

**Choice 3:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

- **Criterion 1:** This choice effectively extracts atomic statements. Each statement is distinct, capturing individual obligations clearly.
- **Criterion 2:** Like the previous choices, there are no clauses that begin with "if."

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all choices:
- Choice 1 and Choice 3 both provide clear atomic statements. However, Choice 3 uses slightly more precise verbs ("articulate" and "describe") which may convey a deeper engagement with the content.
- Choice 2 combines important elements, making it less atomic and less clear.

Therefore, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**
   - This is an essential atomic statement extracted directly from the law article.
   
2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**
   - This statement accurately captures an important requirement from the law article.

3. **Researchers must state the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**
   - This is a clear extraction, but it separates the nature and objectives, which could be consolidated.

4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**
   - This is an accurate statement, but it does not explicitly link the anticipated benefit with the nature and objectives as stated in the law article.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**
   - This statement is also accurately extracted.

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**  
   - This is correctly extracted.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**  
   - This statement is accurate.

3. **Researchers must outline the nature and objectives of the research and the anticipated public or scientific benefit in the research plan.**  
   - This combines the nature, objectives, and anticipated benefits into a single statement, which may simplify the model but loses specificity.

4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**  
   - This statement is accurate.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**
   - This is correctly extracted.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**
   - This is an accurate extraction.

3. **Researchers must articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**
   - This is a clear and specific extraction, though "articulate" is more verbose than necessary.

4. **Researchers must describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**
   - This provides a clear separation of the anticipated benefits but could lead to redundancy.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**
   - This statement is also accurately extracted.

### Conclusion:
- **Criterion 1** is best met in **Choice 1** and **Choice 3**, as they retain the specificity of nature, objectives, and benefit.
- **Criterion 2** is not applicable directly since there are no clauses starting with "if" in the law article.
- **Choice 1** provides a clear distinction for each requirement, while **Choice 2** simplifies it at the expense of some clarity. **Choice 3** retains clarity and specificity but uses more verbose language.
  
After careful consideration, the best choice is **1**, as it provides the clearest and most detailed extraction of atomic statements while maintaining all necessary components.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To evaluate the choices based on the criteria provided, we will analyze each one in detail, focusing on the extraction of atomic statements and the identification of preconditions.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements clearly outline the requirements for researchers, ensuring that each aspect of the law article is addressed distinctly.
   - Each statement is clear and atomic, meaning that they convey one piece of information each.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no clauses starting with "if" in the law article, so no preconditions need to be extracted. This choice does not specifically address preconditions, but that's not an issue since the article does not contain any.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements combine the nature and objectives of the research along with the anticipated public or scientific benefit into one statement. This reduces the clarity and atomicity, as it combines two distinct pieces of information.
   - Other statements are clear and atomic, but the combination in statement 3 is a drawback.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are no clauses starting with "if," so preconditions are not relevant here.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice maintains the atomicity of each requirement by clearly separating the nature and objectives of the research from the anticipated public or scientific benefit.
   - Each statement is distinct and conveys one specific requirement, which is beneficial for clarity and compliance.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Again, as with the previous choices, there are no "if" clauses, so preconditions are not applicable.

### Conclusion:
Considering the criteria, Choice 1 has clear atomic statements but combines the nature and objectives with anticipated benefits in Choice 2, which reduces clarity. Choice 3 maintains complete atomicity of statements without compromising clarity. Therefore, the best choice is clearly the one that preserves distinctiveness in all atomic statements.

The best choice is **3**.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This section accurately captures the obligations of researchers without including any preconditions. All five statements are clear and directly derived from the law article.
  
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: Each statement includes the actor (Researchers), the modal verb (must), and classifies the modality correctly as an obligation. However, the mention of "Precondition(s): None" is included in the format, which violates Criterion 1 because it introduces a description of preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, this section also extracts the obligations correctly without any preconditions.
  
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice presents the classification in a more structured format without mentioning preconditions. Each statement retains clarity, and the classification is accurate, fulfilling both criteria successfully.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Like the previous choices, this section extracts the obligations correctly.
  
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: Although the structure is clear, the inclusion of "Precondition(s): None" violates Criterion 1. Each statement is otherwise well-formatted and correctly classified as an obligation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Choice 2 is the only option that successfully meets both criteria without including any description of preconditions. Choices 1 and 3 both fail to adhere to Criterion 1. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction of atomic statements is clear and concise. 
- **Classification and Formatting**: Each obligation is properly classified with the modal verb "must," indicating an obligation. 
- **Action descriptions**: Each action description does not include any precondition, aligning with Criterion 1.
- **Obligation Classification**: All statements are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 2:
- **Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, the extraction of atomic statements is effective.
- **Classification and Formatting**: Each statement is formatted consistently and clearly states the obligations.
- **Action descriptions**: There are no preconditions included in the action descriptions, which meets Criterion 1.
- **Obligation Classification**: Like Choice 1, all statements are classified as obligations, thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 3:
- **Atomic Legal Statements**: Again, the extraction of atomic statements is clear and effective.
- **Classification and Formatting**: This choice includes a section for preconditions for each obligation.
- **Action descriptions**: Each action description does not include any precondition, which aligns with Criterion 1. However, the inclusion of "Precondition(s): None" is redundant in the context of the requirement to avoid precondition descriptions.
- **Obligation Classification**: All statements are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
While all choices fulfill the obligation classification and the description of actions without preconditions, Choices 1 and 2 are more effective as they avoid redundancy. Choice 3, while still meeting the criteria, introduces unnecessary information by stating "Precondition(s): None." Thus, it is less optimal.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the three choices regarding the extraction and classification of atomic legal statements from the law article, we will analyze them based on the specified criteria.

### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The extraction of statements is clear and accurately reflects the requirements set out in the law article.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** Each atomic legal statement is classified correctly as an obligation, without including any preconditions. However, it does explicitly mention "Precondition(s): None," which, while accurate, introduces a redundancy since it does not need to be stated explicitly.
  
**Criterion Evaluation:**
1. The description of actions does not include preconditions, but mentioning "Precondition(s): None" is unnecessary.
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations correctly.

**Choice 1 Conclusion:** While it meets the criteria, the unnecessary mention of preconditions detracts slightly from its clarity.

---

**Choice 2:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** Similar to Choice 1, the atomic statements extracted are accurate and represent the law article effectively.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** Each statement is formatted in a structured way, clearly indicating the actor, modal verb, modality, and action. There is no mention of preconditions, which aligns well with the criteria.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
1. The description of actions does not include preconditions, as there is no mention of "Precondition(s): None."
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations accurately.

**Choice 2 Conclusion:** This choice adheres well to the criteria without unnecessary redundancy, making it clear and concise.

---

**Choice 3:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The extraction is accurate and mirrors the requirements of the law article as in the other choices.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** Each statement is well-structured, with the inclusion of "Precondition(s): None," which again introduces redundancy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
1. The description of actions does not include preconditions, but the explicit mention of "Precondition(s): None" is redundant.
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations correctly.

**Choice 3 Conclusion:** This choice meets the criteria but suffers from the same redundancy issue as Choice 1, making it slightly less effective.

---

### Final Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices, Choice 2 stands out as the best option due to its clear extraction and classification of atomic legal statements without unnecessary redundancy. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. The description of actions does not mention any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1.
2. Each statement is classified correctly as an obligation, thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. Similar to Choice 1, the description of actions does not include any preconditions, meeting Criterion 1.
2. All atomic statements are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. While the descriptions of actions do not include any preconditions, the inclusion of "Precondition(s): None" in each atomic legal statement is technically unnecessary and could imply that there are preconditions. This could lead to ambiguity regarding Criterion 1.
2. Like the previous choices, all statements are classified as obligations, meeting Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices, Choice 1 and Choice 2 both meet the criteria effectively, but they present information more concisely than Choice 3. However, since Choice 1 presents the information without the added structure of numbering, it seems less organized. Choice 2, which maintains clarity and organization without ambiguity regarding preconditions, stands out as the best option.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
- The atomic legal statements are extracted and classified correctly. 
- Each statement has been formatted with the actor, modal verb, modality, and action(s).
- However, the inclusion of "Precondition(s): None" in the classification section contradicts Criterion 1, which states that descriptions of actions should not include descriptions of preconditions. Thus, this choice does not fully comply with all criteria.

### Choice 2:
- This choice also extracts the same atomic legal statements.
- The format for classifying and formatting the atomic legal statements is clear and structured.
- Importantly, there are no precondition statements included in the classification section, which adheres to Criterion 1.
- All statements are classified as obligations, meeting Criterion 2.

### Choice 3:
- Like the previous choices, this one extracts the atomic legal statements correctly.
- However, it includes "Precondition(s): None" in each classification, which violates Criterion 1.
- Similar to Choice 1, despite correct extraction and classification, the inclusion of preconditions detracts from its compliance with the criteria.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices in detail, Choice 2 stands out as the best option. It adheres to both criteria by omitting preconditions and classifying all actions as obligations without any contradiction.

The best choice is 2.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.
— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

This Legal GRL model captures the obligations of researchers regarding the preparation of a research plan as specified by the law article. Each obligation is represented as a Goal, and currently, no explicit preconditions are mentioned, so the model does not include them. The dependencies connect the obligations but do not link to any preconditions since none were defined in the legal statements.

 Let's analyze each choice with respect to the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model does not explicitly define any Precondition IntentionalElements. All elements are obligations, meaning no explicit source for a Dependency is a Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model lists the sources of Dependencies as the obligations themselves, and the targets are also obligations, which does not satisfy the requirement that the target must be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements as each intentional element has a unique description.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This choice fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no IntentionalElements of type Goal with modality Precondition present in the model.
2. **Criterion 2**: The sources are obligations, and the targets are also obligations. Thus, it does not meet the requirement for the target to be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements with the same descriptions.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: This choice also fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Again, there are no IntentionalElements of type Goal with modality Precondition, which means that the source of a Dependency is not a Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model has the same issue where the sources are obligations and the targets are also obligations. This does not meet the requirement that the target must be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements; each intentional element is unique.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice also fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Summary of Findings:
All three choices exhibit the same fundamental issues: they lack the necessary Precondition IntentionalElements and thus do not establish valid Dependencies according to the specified criteria. However, all choices successfully avoid duplication of elements.

Given that all choices fail to satisfy the essential criteria, it is challenging to determine a "best choice" based on the provided criteria. However, since they all have the same shortcomings, we will select the first valid choice encountered.

**The best choice is 1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 ### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:
- **Extracted Statements**: Clearly captures all obligations of researchers as per the legal article.
- **Classification**: Each action is correctly classified under the modality of Obligation.
- **Model Elements**:
  - Each IntentionalElement is unique and does not duplicate descriptions.
  - **Dependencies**: All dependencies link a goal to itself. This does not satisfy Criterion 2, as the target of the dependencies must be either an «Obligation» or an «Permission» that is distinct from the source.
- **Conclusion**: While the model is structured correctly, it does not fulfill all criteria, specifically the nature of dependencies.

#### Choice 2:
- **Extracted Statements**: Matches the obligations noted in the law article.
- **Classification**: Each obligation is accurately classified.
- **Model Elements**:
  - The IntentionalElements are unique, avoiding duplication.
  - **Dependencies**: Similar to Choice 1, the dependencies do not connect to different target elements, only linking each element to itself.
- **Conclusion**: This choice also fails to satisfy Criterion 2 due to the nature of the dependencies.

#### Choice 3:
- **Extracted Statements**: Mirrors the obligations from the law article accurately.
- **Classification**: All obligations are categorized correctly as Goals with Obligation modality.
- **Model Elements**:
  - Unique IntentionalElements are presented without duplication.
  - **Dependencies**: Like the previous choices, the dependencies link each element to itself, which does not align with the requirements of Criteria 1 and 2.
- **Conclusion**: This choice similarly does not fulfill the criteria due to the nature of the dependencies.

### Overall Conclusion
All choices present a similar structure and content. They accurately reflect the obligations of the researchers but fail to establish meaningful dependencies that meet the criteria laid out. Since all three choices exhibit the same weaknesses, they are equally inadequate in fulfilling the model requirements.

Given the analysis, the best choice is **1** (as it is the first choice presented and is treated as the default when all choices are equally acceptable). Thus:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To analyze the three provided choices for generating Legal GRL models from law articles with a focus on the focal actors, Researchers, let's evaluate them based on the stated criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: There is no explicit «Precondition» identified in the model. All intentional elements are categorized as Goals with modality Obligation, which doesn't satisfy the requirement for a Dependency to originate from a «Precondition».
2. **Criterion 2**: Similar to Criterion 1, the sources of Dependencies are all Goals, and there are no Dependencies targeting an «Obligation» or «Permission» from a «Precondition». The structure does not allow for a clear representation of these relationships.
3. **Criterion 3**: There is no duplication of model elements; each Goal has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: As with Choice 1, there are no «Precondition» elements identified, meaning that no Dependency can originate from a «Precondition».
2. **Criterion 2**: Again, the model fails to meet this criterion as there are no Dependencies from a «Precondition» to an «Obligation» or «Permission».
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements in this choice as well, similar to Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Choice 3, too, does not feature any «Precondition» elements. All elements are classified as Goals, and therefore, it does not meet the requirement for a Dependency to originate from a «Precondition».
2. **Criterion 2**: The model does not comply with this criterion as well, as the Dependencies are not derived from a «Precondition» but from Goals.
3. **Criterion 3**: There is no duplication of model elements in this choice either; each Goal remains unique.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the critical criteria regarding the presence of «Precondition» elements. However, all three choices do abide by Criterion 3, as there are no duplications in the model elements. Given that all choices are structurally similar in failing to address the Dependency requirements properly, the best choice based on clarity and coherence in representing the obligations of researchers is:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: There is no explicit indication of a precondition (an intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition) as the source of a Dependency. All dependencies are linked to Goals with modality Obligation.
2. **Criterion 2**: The sources of dependencies are all Goals with modality Obligation. However, the target of each dependency is also the same Obligation, which does not satisfy the requirement that the target should be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in the model elements; all descriptions are unique.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, there is no indication of a precondition as the source of a Dependency. All dependencies are linked to Goals with modality Obligation.
2. **Criterion 2**: Again, the sources of dependencies are Goals (Obligation), but they target themselves, which does not meet the requirement of having the target as either an Obligation or Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in the model elements; all descriptions are unique.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Like the previous choices, there is no precondition as the source of a Dependency. All dependencies are linked to Goals with modality Obligation.
2. **Criterion 2**: The same issue persists where the dependencies link Goals to themselves. The targets of the dependencies do not include an Obligation or Permission as required.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in the model elements; all descriptions are unique.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to satisfy Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, as none of them include a precondition as the source of a Dependency, and all dependencies target themselves, which does not meet the specified requirements. However, they all adhere to Criterion 3 as there are no duplicated elements.

Given that all three choices exhibit similar issues, I would conclude that none of the choices fully meet the criteria set out. However, since they are all formulated in a similar manner and reflect the obligations of the researchers, the best choice is arbitrary in this context. I would select:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes dependencies, but the source of each dependency is the same as the target (i.e., source: IE1, target: IE1), which does not establish a clear precondition leading to another obligation or permission.
2. **Criterion 2**: The dependencies link each goal to itself. This means that while they are obligations, there is no proper linkage to another obligation or permission that would satisfy this criterion.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in model elements; each intentional element (IE) has a unique description.

### Choice 2:
1. **Criterion 1**: Like Choice 1, the dependencies link each goal to itself, failing to meet the requirement that a precondition connects to another obligation or permission.
2. **Criterion 2**: The same issue persists here as well; the dependencies do not connect to any other elements, meaning this criterion is also not fulfilled.
3. **Criterion 3**: No duplications are present in the model elements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to the previous choices, this model does not have a precondition that serves as the source for a dependency leading to another obligation or permission.
2. **Criterion 2**: The dependencies are self-referential again, which means it does not meet this criterion either.
3. **Criterion 3**: This model also avoids duplication of model elements.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria regarding the establishment of proper dependencies among intentional elements. They are structurally similar, each representing the obligations of researchers without adequately linking them to preconditions. However, there are no significant differences among the choices in terms of fulfilling the criteria.

Given that all choices exhibit the same deficiencies and strengths, no choice stands out as particularly better than the others. Thus, the best choice is **1** as it is the first option presented, which aligns with the premise of selecting one choice among the available options despite the shortcomings. 

The best choice is 1.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

To generate a new proposal, you apply some changes to the proposal below and then return the modified elements:

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Formulate Propositional Logic**:
   The obligations can be represented as propositional logic:
   - O1: Researchers prepare a research plan in writing.
   - O2: Researchers include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
   - O3: Researchers articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
   - O4: Researchers describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
   - O5: Researchers include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

   The overall propositional logic can be expressed as:
   O1 AND O2 AND O3 AND O4 AND O5.

2. **Syntax Tree**:
   The syntax tree for the above propositional logic can be represented as:
   ```
       AND
      / |  |  | \
    O1 O2 O3 O4 O5
   ```
   
3. **Sub Intentional Elements**:
   Based on the above tree, we can create sub-intentional elements:
   - O1: Researchers prepare a research plan in writing.
   - O2: Researchers include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
   - O3: Researchers articulate the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
   - O4: Researchers describe the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
   - O5: Researchers include all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.
   - O_AND: All obligations must be satisfied.

4. **Decompositions**:
   The decompositions based on the syntax tree:
   - Obligation O_AND is decomposed into obligations O1, O2, O3, O4, and O5 using AND Decomposition.

5. **Contribution Links**:
   For each obligation, we assume that the satisfaction of each individual obligation contributes positively to the overall obligation being satisfied. Thus, contribution links will be established:
   - O1 contributes positively to O_AND.
   - O2 contributes positively to O_AND.
   - O3 contributes positively to O_AND.
   - O4 contributes positively to O_AND.
   - O5 contributes positively to O_AND.

The decomposition type is set to AND, indicating that all obligations must be satisfied for the precondition to be fulfilled. Each obligation connects to the precondition via dependencies, capturing the relationships among these legal requirements effectively.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided, focusing on the decomposition and target elements involved.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This captures all necessary obligations for the researchers.
- **Classification**: All actions are classified correctly as "Obligation."
- **Model Creation**: The model lists five obligations (IE1 - IE5), all of which are of the same type (Goal) and modality (Obligation).
- **Decompositions**: The model attempts to create a decomposition for each obligation individually, but does not satisfy the requirement of having a decomposition with more than one element as a target. Each obligation is decomposed into itself, which does not fulfill the criteria of Criterion 2.
  
This choice fails on Criterion 2 since no decomposition target includes more than one element (all targets are single elements).

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, this captures the same obligations.
- **Classification**: All obligations are classified appropriately as "Obligation."
- **Model Creation**: The structure is almost identical to Choice 1, listing five obligations.
- **Decompositions**: Like Choice 1, the dependencies link each obligation to itself, failing to create a meaningful decomposition that involves multiple intentional elements.

This choice also fails on Criterion 2 for the same reasons as Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice includes the same obligations as the previous choices.
- **Classification**: Obligations are classified correctly as "Obligation."
- **Model Creation**: This model introduces a new intentional element (IE6) that encapsulates all the requirements of the research plan.
- **Decompositions**: The decomposition links IE6 (the overall requirement) to all individual obligations (IE1 - IE5) using an AND decomposition, thus satisfying both criteria. Specifically:
  - Criterion 1: All decomposed elements are of the same type (Goal) and modality (Obligation).
  - Criterion 2: The decomposition target includes multiple elements (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5).

This choice successfully meets both criteria and offers a comprehensive model.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing each choice against the specified criteria, it is clear that Choice 3 stands out as the most effective and compliant model for generating Legal GRL models from law articles from the researchers' perspective. 

The best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each of the choices based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: This choice correctly decomposes the obligations into the same type, which is "Obligation". Each obligation is treated consistently and appropriately, aligning with Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The decomposition of the overall obligation (O_AND) into individual obligations (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5) meets Criterion 2, as it involves more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice maintains the same type of intentional elements for decomposition (all obligations). It adheres to Criterion 1 well.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: However, this choice fails to demonstrate any combined obligation or overarching goal. Each obligation is treated independently without a higher-level decomposition, meaning it does not satisfy Criterion 2 effectively (as it does not target more than one intentional element).

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: This choice introduces an overall intentional element (IE6), which is a positive aspect; however, it mixes modalities by introducing a "Obligation" along with obligations. This violates Criterion 1 as it does not maintain consistent types within the decomposition.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The decomposition of the obligation into separate obligations does target multiple intentional elements and satisfies Criterion 2. However, the mixed modalities weaken the integrity of the model.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- Choice 1 successfully adheres to both criteria, establishing a clear and consistent model that allows for a structured representation of obligations.
- Choice 2 lacks a higher-level goal, failing Criterion 2.
- Choice 3, while introducing a new intentional element, violates Criterion 1 due to mixing modalities.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - All intentional elements are of the same type (Obligation) and modality, which satisfies Criterion 1.
   - However, the model uses self-dependency (e.g., `IE1` depends on `IE1`), which does not contribute to a meaningful decomposition of obligations.
   - The decomposition of `O_AND` into `O1, O2, O3, O4, O5` is correctly done as it has more than one intentional element, satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model captures all obligations systematically, and the dependencies among obligations are clearly defined.
   - The propositional logic representation is accurate and aligns with the requirements of the law article.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, all intentional elements are of the same type and modality, satisfying Criterion 1.
   - However, again, self-dependencies are used (e.g., `IE1` depends on `IE1`), which does not advance the model's meaningfulness.
   - There are no decompositions that combine multiple elements into a higher-level obligation, which fails to fully leverage the modeling capabilities.

2. **Overall Structure**:
   - The obligations are listed correctly, but the lack of meaningful decomposition means it does not highlight the interdependencies between obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - All intentional elements are of the same type and modality, satisfying Criterion 1.
   - The new intentional element `IE6` acts as a obligation and effectively aggregates all obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2 as it decomposes into multiple other obligations.
   
2. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model's use of a obligation adds depth and reflects the comprehensive requirement of the law article.
   - Dependencies link obligations to the obligation, reinforcing their relationships effectively.

### Conclusion:
When evaluating the choices based on the criteria:
- **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** both fail to provide meaningful decompositions and rely on self-dependencies.
- **Choice 3**, however, introduces a obligation that encapsulates the obligations, showing a clear hierarchical relationship among the elements and effectively modeling the intent of the law article.

Thus, "The best choice is 3".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the three choices for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, we will analyze each choice based on the specified criteria regarding intentional elements, decomposition requirements, and the overall clarity and structure of the models.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - The model contains several obligations that are all classified as "Goal" type under the modality "Obligation." This adheres to Criterion 1 since all decompositions are between intentional elements of the same type and modality.
   - However, the decomposition type is incorrectly specified as "Dependency" for each element rather than establishing a clear decomposition structure for the overall obligation.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model does not create a single overarching obligation that encompasses all individual obligations as described in the law article. This violates Criterion 2 since there is no element targeting more than one intentional element for decomposition.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model captures the requirements well, but the lack of a clear decomposed structure is a significant shortcoming. 

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, the model respects Criterion 1 by keeping all obligations under the same modality.
   - The elements are treated as individual goals without a clear overarching obligation, failing to establish appropriate decompositions.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - There is no decomposition that targets multiple intentional elements. This is a clear violation of Criterion 2.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model is organized, but it lacks a higher-level goal that encompasses the individual obligations, which is a missed opportunity for clarity and coherence.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - This choice introduces an overall goal (IE6) that combines all individual obligations into one overarching requirement, which adheres to Criterion 1 by keeping the decomposition within the same modality of "Obligation."
   - The model effectively decomposes the overall obligation into its constituent parts (IE1 to IE5), satisfying the decomposition requirements.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition specifically targets multiple elements (IE1 to IE5), fulfilling Criterion 2 as it illustrates a clear relationship between the overall obligation and its components.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model clearly presents the relationships between the obligations and the overall requirement. The introduction of the obligation (IE6) adds clarity and emphasizes the necessity of all obligations being satisfied, making it the most effective model for representing the legal requirements.

### Conclusion:
Considering the adherence to the criteria for decomposition and structural clarity, the best choice is 3. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
- The model effectively extracts atomic legal statements and represents them as obligations.
- All intentional elements are of the same type (Obligation).
- Each obligation is treated as a separate intentional element, which aligns well with Criterion 1.
- However, the decomposition of the overall obligation (O_AND) into individual obligations (O1, O2, O3, O4, O5) could be more clearly defined. The current representation lacks clarity on how these obligations interact to fulfill the overall requirement.
- The model doesn't utilize permissions or preconditions, but it could benefit from establishing a clear decomposition that shows how the individual obligations relate to the overall goal.

**Choice 2:**
- Similar to Choice 1, it extracts atomic legal statements and organizes them as obligations.
- It adheres to Criterion 1, as all intentional elements are of the same type (Obligation).
- However, it fails to provide any decomposition of the obligations. Each obligation stands alone without demonstrating how they contribute to a larger goal.
- The absence of any decomposition or contribution links means it does not satisfy Criterion 2 effectively.

**Choice 3:**
- This model also extracts atomic legal statements and classifies them as obligations.
- It introduces a obligation (IE6) that encompasses all obligations, thereby fulfilling Criterion 1.
- The decomposition from the obligation to individual obligations shows a clear relationship among the elements, satisfying Criterion 2 by indicating that multiple obligations must be satisfied to fulfill the obligation.
- The model captures the interdependencies effectively, making it a more holistic representation of the legal requirements.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices based on the criteria of decomposition and the nature of intentional elements, it is evident that Choice 3 provides the most robust and comprehensive model. It successfully captures the relationships between the obligations and the overall requirements of the research plan while adhering to the specified criteria.

The best choice is 3.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 To evaluate each choice against the criteria provided, we will analyze how well each option adheres to the requirements for extracting atomic statements and preconditions related to the law article.

**Choice 1:**
1. Researchers must create a research plan in writing.  
   - This statement meets Criterion 1 as it is atomic and captures an obligation for researchers.
2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.  
   - This is also an atomic statement that reflects a specific requirement from the law article.
3. Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.  
   - This statement is atomic and fulfills the requirement.
4. Researchers must explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.  
   - This is a well-structured atomic statement, aligning with the law's requirements.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.  
   - This statement is general but still atomic and fits within the requirements.

**Choice 2:**
1. Researchers must have a written research plan.  
   - This is an effective atomic statement but slightly less precise than "create a research plan in writing."
2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.  
   - This is an atomic statement and correctly captures a requirement.
3. Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research.  
   - This meets Criterion 1, but "describe" is slightly less direct than "define."
4. Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research.  
   - This is an adequate atomic statement, though "outline" is less definitive than "explain."
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.  
   - This is a valid atomic statement.

**Choice 3:**
1. Researchers must create a research plan in writing.  
   - This is a strong atomic statement that meets Criterion 1.
2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.  
   - This is an atomic statement that aligns with the law requirements.
3. Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.  
   - This statement combines multiple requirements into one, which can violate the atomicity criterion since it merges two distinct obligations.
4. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.  
   - This is an acceptable atomic statement.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all the choices with respect to the criteria, Choice 1 stands out because it maintains atomicity in all the extracted statements and ensures that each requirement is clear and precise. Choices 2 and 3 have some deficiencies in clarity and atomicity, especially Choice 3, which combines different requirements into one statement. 

Thus, the best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - This statement is clear and aligns with the requirement for a written plan, satisfying Criterion 1.
   
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement directly addresses the requirement and is atomic, thereby meeting Criterion 1.
   
3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - This is a clear and distinct requirement, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   
4. **Researchers must explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.**
   - This is a precise statement that reflects the intent of the law, thus satisfying Criterion 1.
   
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This is an adequate summary of the requirement without ambiguity, meeting Criterion 1.

Overall, Choice 1 provides a comprehensive extraction of atomic statements, but it does not address any conditional clauses, as there are no "if" statements in the law article.

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must have a written research plan.**
   - This is a clear statement, satisfying Criterion 1.
   
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This is a direct and atomic statement, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   
3. **Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - This aligns well with the law's requirements and is atomic, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   
4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research.**
   - This statement captures the intent but uses "outline," which can be slightly less definitive than "explain," though it remains atomic.
   
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This is acceptable and meets Criterion 1.

Choice 2 also provides a good extraction of atomic statements. However, similar to Choice 1, it does not address any conditional clauses.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - A clear and atomic statement, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement is direct and atomic, meeting Criterion 1.
   
3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**
   - This statement combines multiple requirements into one. While it is atomic, it makes the statement longer and potentially less clear.
   
4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This statement is straightforward and meets Criterion 1.

Choice 3 successfully extracts atomic statements; however, the third statement is less clear due to combining multiple aspects, which can complicate understanding.

### Conclusion:
Considering all choices, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 provide clear and atomic statements, but Choice 2 uses slightly more precise language. Choice 3, while still valid, combines elements in a way that may diminish clarity.

The best choice is 2.

   - **Criterion 1:** This clearly states the need for outlining benefits.
  
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**  
   - **Criterion 1:** This is clear and meets the requirement.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**  
   - **Criterion 1:** This is a clear statement and meets the requirement.
  
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**  
   - **Criterion 1:** This is clear and meets the requirement.
  
3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**  
   - **Criterion 1:** This combines two requirements into one statement, which could be seen as less atomic.
  
4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**  
   - **Criterion 1:** This is clear and meets the requirement.

### Conclusion:
- **Choice 1** provides a clear separation of statements and adequately captures all requirements, including benefits but could be seen as less concise.
- **Choice 2** is clear but combines some elements in a way that could confuse the relationship between the nature of the research and its benefits. 
- **Choice 3** succeeds in capturing the relationship but sacrifices clarity and atomicity by merging two statements.

Given that atomicity and clarity are crucial for the focal actor (researchers), **Choice 1** stands out the most as it maintains a clear structure while ensuring all elements are addressed separately.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - This statement is clear and captures the requirement for a written plan.
   
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement accurately reflects the requirement regarding affiliations.

3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - This captures the essence of the requirement but does not explicitly mention the public or scientific benefit.

4. **Researchers must explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.**
   - This statement captures the anticipated benefits but separates it from the nature and objectives of the research, which may not align with the original article's requirement.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This is a straightforward extraction of the remaining requirement.

**Analysis:** Choice 1 does a good job of extracting key elements but splits the requirement about nature, objectives, and anticipated benefit into two separate statements, which could lead to confusion about their relationship.

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must have a written research plan.**
   - This captures the requirement for a written plan effectively.

2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement is accurate and clear.

3. **Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - Similar to Choice 1, this does not mention the public or scientific benefit, which is a critical component of the requirement.

4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research.**
   - This separation is similar to Choice 1 and may lead to a misunderstanding of their relationship.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This accurately reflects the article's requirement.

**Analysis:** Choice 2 follows a similar pattern as Choice 1, separating related concepts and not fully capturing the interconnectedness of the nature, objectives, and benefits of the research.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - This captures the written requirement accurately.

2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This is a correct extraction.

3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**
   - This statement effectively combines the nature, objectives, and anticipated benefits into a single comprehensive statement, which aligns with the original article.

4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This is clear and concise.

**Analysis:** Choice 3 effectively captures the essence of the law article by combining related concepts into a single statement, ensuring clarity and coherence in the requirements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices based on the specified criteria, it is clear that Choice 3 provides the most comprehensive and coherent model for the requirements set forth in the law article. It ensures that atomic statements are extracted appropriately and does not split related concepts, adhering well to both criteria.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - This statement captures the requirement that the plan must be written, which aligns well with the law article.
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement accurately reflects the requirement for disclosing affiliations.
3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - This captures the essence of what is required regarding the nature and objectives of the research.
4. **Researchers must explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.**
   - This statement accurately conveys the requirement for researchers to explain the anticipated benefits.
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This is a broad statement that effectively covers any additional requirements.

**Criterion 1:** All statements are atomic and extracted from the perspective of researchers.
**Criterion 2:** There are no clauses starting with "if," so this criterion is not applicable here.

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must have a written research plan.**
   - This captures the requirement for a written plan, similar to choice 1 but less explicit.
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement is identical to choice 1 and captures the requirement correctly.
3. **Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research.**
   - This captures the essence but uses "describe" instead of "define," which may imply less precision.
4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research.**
   - The term "outline" is less definitive than "explain," potentially making it less clear what is required.
5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This statement is identical to choice 1.

**Criterion 1:** All statements are atomic, but some verb choices are less precise.
**Criterion 2:** Again, there are no "if" clauses, so this is not applicable.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**
   - This mirrors the first statement in choice 1, capturing the written requirement.
2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**
   - This statement is consistent with previous choices.
3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**
   - This statement combines multiple requirements into one, which may reduce clarity since it mixes objectives with anticipated benefits.
4. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**
   - This statement is consistent with previous choices.

**Criterion 1:** The first two statements are atomic, but the third statement is not, as it combines multiple ideas.
**Criterion 2:** Again, there are no "if" clauses present.

### Conclusion:
Choice 1 presents the clearest and most atomic statements, ensuring that each requirement is distinct and precise from the perspective of researchers. Choice 2 is slightly less precise in verb choice, and Choice 3 combines requirements, which could lead to confusion.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. The atomic legal statements are extracted correctly, with each action clearly stated.
2. Each action is classified as an obligation, following the appropriate modality.
3. There is no mention of any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1.

### Choice 2:
1. Similar to Choice 1, the atomic legal statements are correctly extracted.
2. All actions are classified as obligations, aligning with the requirement for classification (Criterion 2).
3. The format used to present the statements does not include any preconditions, thus satisfying Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. The extraction of atomic legal statements is accurate, just as in the previous choices.
2. Each action is classified as an obligation, fulfilling the classification requirement (Criterion 2).
3. However, the use of "N/A" for preconditions does not comply with Criterion 1 because it implies the existence of preconditions, even if they are not applicable. This could confuse the reader regarding the intent of the criterion.

### Conclusion:
Choices 1 and 2 both meet the criteria effectively. However, Choice 3's use of "N/A" for preconditions undermines its compliance with Criterion 1 despite the overall correctness of other elements.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Criterion 1**: All actions are described without mentioning any preconditions. This criterion is satisfied.
- **Criterion 2**: Each atomic legal statement is classified as an obligation. This criterion is satisfied.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, all actions are described without mentioning any preconditions. This criterion is satisfied.
- **Criterion 2**: Each atomic legal statement is classified as an obligation. This criterion is satisfied.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Criterion 1**: All actions are described without mentioning any preconditions; however, the term "N/A" is used instead of "None." While this does not introduce any preconditions, it is somewhat unconventional compared to "None." Nevertheless, it does not violate the criterion.
- **Criterion 2**: Each atomic legal statement is classified as an obligation. This criterion is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
While all three choices meet the established criteria, Choices 1 and 2 are more straightforward and conventional in their presentation. They provide clarity by stating "None" for preconditions, which may be more easily understood in legal contexts. Choice 3 technically adheres to the criteria but uses "N/A," which could introduce ambiguity and is less common in legal formatting.

Considering these aspects, the best choice is **1**. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. The action descriptions are clear and do not include any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1.
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2.

### Choice 2:
1. The action descriptions are also clear and do not include any preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3:
1. The action descriptions are clear and do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations, which aligns with Criterion 2. However, the use of "N/A" for preconditions is less standard than "None," suggesting a slight inconsistency in formatting.

### Conclusion:
While all choices adhere to the criteria, Choices 1 and 2 present the information in a cleaner format without the ambiguity introduced by "N/A." Since both Choices 1 and 2 are equally valid in terms of compliance with the criteria, they stand out more than Choice 3. However, the clarity and simplicity of Choice 1 make it slightly preferable.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the domain description.

**Choice 1:**
- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements:** The extraction of statements is accurate, capturing all necessary elements.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - Each statement correctly identifies the modal verb "must" and the modality as an obligation.
  - **Criterion 1:** All action descriptions do not include preconditions, which is compliant.
  - **Criterion 2:** All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate.
  
Overall, this choice meets both criteria effectively.

**Choice 2:**
- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements:** Again, the extraction of statements is correct and complete.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - The classification follows the same format as Choice 1.
  - **Criterion 1:** There are no preconditions included in the action descriptions, satisfying the requirement.
  - **Criterion 2:** All classified statements are obligations, which is correct.

This choice also meets both criteria successfully.

**Choice 3:**
- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements:** The statements are accurately extracted and complete.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - The classification is done similarly to the previous choices.
  - **Criterion 1:** There are no preconditions included in the action descriptions; however, using "N/A" instead of "None" is a stylistic difference that does not impact compliance.
  - **Criterion 2:** All classified statements are obligations, which is appropriate.

This choice also meets both criteria, although it uses a different notation for precondition absence.

**Conclusion:**
All choices effectively extract and classify the legal statements according to the required criteria. However, Choices 1 and 2 maintain a clearer formatting style by using "None" for preconditions, which may enhance clarity. Since all choices perform equally well in terms of compliance with the criteria but Choices 1 and 2 slightly edge out due to clarity, I will select one of them. 

Therefore, "The best choice is 1."

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

To generate a new proposal, you apply some changes to the proposal below and then return the modified elements:

**Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL:**

```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "Researchers"
        intentionalElements = IE: 
            "IntentionalElement:"

```

In this model, the actor "Researchers" is created, and each obligation is represented as an Intentional Element (Goal). Since there are no preconditions in any of the statements, no Precondition Intentional Elements have been created or linked. The Contributions demonstrate the relationships among the goals without dependencies, as there are no preconditions specified.

2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.  
3. Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.  
4. Researchers must explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.  
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This step identifies the obligations of researchers correctly based on the law article.
   
2. **Classification**: All obligations are correctly classified as "Obligation" modality under the actor "Researchers". However, there are no preconditions defined for any of the obligations.

3. **Modeling**: 
   - The model does not create any Dependency links since there are no Precondition Intentional Elements defined.
   - The contributions between the goals do not meet the criteria for dependencies since they lack preconditions, thus failing to establish a valid dependency structure.

**Conclusion**: This choice does not satisfy all criteria, particularly in establishing dependencies based on preconditions.

### Choice 2:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, it identifies the obligations correctly.

2. **Classification**: Again, all obligations are classified correctly. However, there are still no preconditions defined.

3. **Modeling**: 
   - The model attempts to create Dependency links, but they are incorrectly set as self-referential, linking goals to themselves rather than to a valid precondition. This violates Criterion 2, which specifies that the source must be a Precondition and the target either an Obligation or a Permission.

**Conclusion**: This choice does not meet the criteria for establishing valid dependencies and has issues with self-referential links.

### Choice 3:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to the previous choices, it accurately identifies the obligations.

2. **Classification**: All obligations are classified correctly as before, with no preconditions created.

3. **Modeling**: 
   - The model again creates Contribution links that are self-referential. This approach does not establish valid dependencies based on preconditions, violating the established criteria.

**Conclusion**: Like the previous choices, this model fails to meet the criteria for valid dependency establishment.

### Overall Analysis

All three choices correctly extract and classify the obligations from the law article. However, none of the choices successfully establish the necessary dependencies based on preconditions, which is critical to meet the specified criteria. Each choice suffers from self-referential links that do not conform to the requirements for establishing valid dependencies.

**Final Conclusion**: Given that all choices fail to meet the criteria for establishing valid dependencies, it is challenging to definitively select a "best" choice. However, if I must choose the least flawed option based on clearer structure and more organized format, the best choice is **Choice 1** due to its straightforward extraction and classification, albeit with the same underlying issues regarding dependencies.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Preconditions**: There are no Intentional Elements of type Goal with modality Precondition in this model. All obligations are presented without any dependencies linked to a precondition.
   
2. **Dependency Validation**: The model does not establish any dependencies that originate from a precondition. All contributions are made from the same goal (IE1) to other goals, which doesn't satisfy the criteria that the source of a Dependency must be a «Precondition», and the target must be either an «Obligation» or an «Permission».

3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications in model elements; each obligation is uniquely defined.

**Conclusion**: This model fails to satisfy the first two criteria, making it inadequate.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Preconditions**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no Intentional Elements of type Goal with modality Precondition. All obligations are laid out without any precondition basis.

2. **Dependency Validation**: The model incorrectly establishes dependencies where each goal is linked to itself, which does not follow the requirement for a Dependency to originate from a precondition.

3. **Duplication**: No duplications exist in the model elements.

**Conclusion**: This model also fails to meet the first two criteria, rendering it insufficient.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Preconditions**: This model, like the previous two, does not contain any Intentional Elements of type Goal with modality Precondition. There is no foundation for dependencies based on preconditions.

2. **Dependency Validation**: The dependencies are incorrectly defined as each goal is linked to itself, which again does not comply with the criteria that require the source of a Dependency to be a precondition.

3. **Duplication**: No duplications in model elements are present.

**Conclusion**: This model similarly fails to meet the first two criteria, making it inadequate.

### Overall Conclusion:
All three choices fail to satisfy the critical criteria, particularly concerning the requirement for establishing dependencies originating from a precondition. Given that none of the choices can effectively fulfill the purpose of generating Legal GRL models from law articles according to the specified criteria, a valid selection cannot be made based on the given options.

However, if forced to select the best choice based solely on the structure and clarity of the model, and considering no duplication exists in any of the choices while they all share the same shortcomings, it would be a matter of preference for formatting. In that context, Choice 3 appears to have a slightly clearer syntactic structure than the others, though it still does not meet the necessary criteria.

Thus, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This step is correctly executed by extracting the obligations from the law article.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: Each obligation is classified accurately, but none of the elements are marked as a "Precondition". This is a critical oversight because it fails to establish the necessary dependencies.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**: The model shows that there are contributions based on the goals, but since there are no preconditions created, there are no dependencies in the model. This violates Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, as there are no dependencies linking preconditions to obligations or permissions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, the obligations are extracted correctly.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: The obligations are classified, but again, no preconditions are established.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**: There are dependencies that link the goals to themselves, which does not provide any meaningful relationship or dependency structure. This also violates Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 since it lacks valid dependencies based on preconditions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction here is consistent with the previous choices.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: The obligations are classified correctly, but as with the previous choices, there are no preconditions.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**: The model similarly links goals to themselves, which does not create any valid dependencies. This violates the same criteria regarding preconditions and dependency relationships.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to create preconditions as required by the criteria. They do not establish valid dependencies between the obligations and any preconditions, which is crucial for proper modeling. 

Given that all choices have similar issues and none of them meet the criteria effectively, it is difficult to determine a clear "best" choice. However, all choices exhibit the same flaws without any significant differences.

Thus, I conclude: "The best choice is 1".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is correct as it captures all the relevant obligations for researchers.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: All entries are classified correctly as obligations. However, there are no preconditions identified, which is a significant point to note.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
   - The model correctly represents the obligations as Intentional Elements but does not include any Precondition Intentional Elements.
   - The dependencies shown are contributions, not dependencies. Since there are no preconditions, this model does not fulfill Criterion 1 or Criterion 2.

### Choice 2:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, the extraction is accurate.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: Obligations are correctly identified, but again, there are no preconditions.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
   - The model has a significant flaw as each dependency is incorrectly linking an Intentional Element to itself (e.g., `source: IE1 target: IE1`). This does not align with the intent of establishing a dependency; thus, it fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2, and it also duplicates the elements, failing Criterion 3.

### Choice 3:

1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice also accurately extracts the obligations.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: Each obligation is classified correctly, with no preconditions identified.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
   - The model shows contributions similar to Choice 1 and Choice 2, but again, they are linking each goal to itself. This does not establish valid dependencies and fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.
   - Furthermore, the model elements are duplicated in terms of their descriptions, which violates Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing all three choices, none of them satisfy the criteria effectively. However, if we were to select the choice that retains more accurate extraction and classification of obligations, **Choice 1** stands out as it does not introduce self-referential dependencies, even though it fails to meet the essential criteria of having preconditions.

Thus, the best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices in detail based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: All five obligations are stated clearly, but they lack any preconditions.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Each obligation is represented as an Intentional Element of type Goal, but there are no dependencies or preconditions established.
  - The contributions imply a relationship, but they fail to establish any dependencies as required by the criteria.
- **Criterion 1**: Not satisfied, as no Intentional Element of type Goal with modality Precondition exists.
- **Criterion 2**: Not satisfied, as there are no dependencies established between a Precondition and either an Obligation or a Permission.
- **Criterion 3**: Satisfied as there are no duplications.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, all obligations are correctly extracted.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**:
  - The model incorrectly establishes a dependency from each goal to itself, which does not make sense in the context of dependencies.
- **Criterion 1**: Not satisfied, as no Intentional Element of type Goal with modality Precondition exists.
- **Criterion 2**: Not satisfied for the same reason; dependencies are incorrectly constructed.
- **Criterion 3**: Satisfied as there are no duplications.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is consistent with the previous choices.
- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**:
  - Like Choice 2, the dependencies link each goal to itself, which doesn't align with the expected structure of dependencies.
- **Criterion 1**: Not satisfied, as no Intentional Element of type Goal with modality Precondition exists.
- **Criterion 2**: Not satisfied due to incorrect dependency structure.
- **Criterion 3**: Satisfied as there are no duplications.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to satisfy Criteria 1 and 2, as they do not create any Precondition Intentional Elements or the required Dependency links. However, they all satisfy Criterion 3 by avoiding duplication of model elements. Given that all choices are fundamentally flawed in meeting the primary criteria of dependency establishment, there is no clear "best choice" among them. 

Thus, based on the analysis, **the best choice is 0** as there are no valid choices meeting the criteria effectively.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

**Refine Legal GRL model:**
To refine the model, we will analyze the obligations and check for potential preconditions or additional details that can be decomposed. Since all items are obligations with no preconditions indicated, we will keep them as they are. However, we can assume that the creation of a research plan could be a precondition for setting out details. 

1. Propositional Logic for Obligations:
   - A: create a research plan in writing.
   - B: set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
   - C: define the nature and objectives of the research.
   - D: explain the public or scientific benefit of the research.
   - E: include all other prescribed matters related to the research.

   The propositional formula can be considered as:
   A and (B and C and D and E)

2. Syntax Tree:
```
        AND
        /          A 
      /        
     AND
    /    B
   /    C
  /    D
 /    E
```

3. Non-root nodes create sub IntentionalElements:
- P_B: set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
- P_C: define the nature and objectives of the research.
- P_D: explain the public or scientific benefit of the research they anticipate.
- P_E: include all other prescribed matters related to the research.
- P_AND_B_C_D_E: set out the affiliation, define the objectives, explain the benefit, and include other matters.

4. Decomposition connections:

### Refine Legal GRL model:

The refined model retains the obligations and adds relevant preconditions derived from the nature of the obligations. The obligations themselves do not have further breakdown since all obligations are standalone without dependencies.

        intentionalElements = IE:

;
```

In this refined model, an additional `Precondition` (IE6) has been introduced to represent the overarching requirement that encapsulates all obligations. Each obligation now has a dependency on this precondition, reflecting the requirement that the obligations are contingent upon the existence of a valid research plan as defined by the law.

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://uniludm.openai.azure.com//openai/deployments/gpt4o-mini/chat/completions?api-version=2024-08-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The decomposition adheres to Criterion 1, as all decomposed elements are of the same type (obligations). The obligations are decomposed correctly into their respective actions. 
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The source element (IE1) is decomposed into four targets (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5), fulfilling Criterion 2 since it involves more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, all decomposed elements are of the same type (obligations), satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The decomposition is based on the single source (IE1) with contributions to multiple targets (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5), which meets Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model includes an additional precondition (IE6), which captures the overarching requirement for the obligations. However, the addition of an overarching precondition does not violate Criterion 1, as the precondition is not decomposed into obligations.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The dependencies from the obligations to the precondition (IE6) indicate that the obligations are contingent upon the precondition, which does not inherently violate Criterion 2. However, it is important to note that the presence of a precondition may introduce complexity in the model that is unnecessary for the specific obligations outlined.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the three choices, both Choices 1 and 2 adhere strictly to the criteria without introducing unnecessary complexity. Choice 1 provides a clear separation of obligations and their decomposition. Choice 3, while also valid, introduces a precondition that complicates the model without adding significant value in this context. 

Thus, the best choice is **1** for its simplicity and clarity in representing the obligations without unnecessary complexity. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria before concluding which is the best model.

### Analysis of Choice 1:

1. **Decomposition**: The model decomposes the primary obligation ("create a research plan in writing") into several obligations (setting out affiliation, defining research objectives, explaining benefits, and including other prescribed matters). All decompositions are between obligations, which is compliant with Criterion 1.

2. **Multiple Targets**: The decomposition links the main obligation to multiple target obligations, satisfying Criterion 2. The model successfully reflects the necessary components of a research plan.

3. **Preconditions**: The introduction of additional intentional elements for preconditions is commendable, as it adds depth to the model. However, it could lead to confusion regarding the structure since not all obligations need to be classified under preconditions.

### Analysis of Choice 2:

1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, all obligations are decomposed correctly under the same modality of obligation, complying with Criterion 1.

2. **Multiple Targets**: The model correctly links the main obligation to multiple target obligations, satisfying Criterion 2.

3. **Lack of Preconditions**: While this model maintains simplicity, it lacks the exploration of preconditions that could enhance understanding of the relationships between obligations.

### Analysis of Choice 3:

1. **Decomposition**: Like the previous choices, the model decomposes obligations in a valid manner. However, it introduces a precondition (IE6) that encompasses the entire set of obligations, which is an interesting approach.

2. **Multiple Targets**: The links to the precondition demonstrate an understanding that the obligations are interconnected, satisfying Criterion 2.

3. **Complexity and Clarity**: The addition of a precondition that wraps all obligations could enhance clarity, but it risks overcomplicating the model if not clearly defined. The structure seems somewhat convoluted as each obligation is now dependent on a single overarching precondition.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, Choice 1 provides a comprehensive breakdown of obligations with appropriately structured decompositions and maintains clarity without overcomplicating the model. While Choices 2 and 3 also meet the criteria, they either lack the depth of preconditions (Choice 2) or introduce complexity that could hinder understanding (Choice 3).

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Decomposition:** The decomposition of `IE1` (creating a research plan) into the other obligations (`IE2`, `IE3`, `IE4`, `IE5`) is valid as it only involves Obligation elements. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition:** The target of the decomposition includes more than one Intentional Element (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 1:
The model effectively adheres to both criteria, maintaining a clear structure that represents obligations correctly.

### Choice 2:
1. **Decomposition:** The model does not introduce any preconditions, and all obligations are treated as standalone elements. There is no further breakdown of the obligations into preconditions or dependencies, which may limit the model's depth.
2. **Target of Decomposition:** There is no decomposition of any element that would fail to meet the criteria of targeting more than one Intentional Element.

### Conclusion for Choice 2:
While this choice meets the basic requirements, it lacks depth in modeling, especially regarding dependencies and preconditions, which could enhance clarity and completeness.

### Choice 3:
1. **Decomposition:** The addition of a precondition (`IE6`) that encapsulates the overall requirement is a positive step towards a more structured model. However, there is no explicit decomposition of the other obligations into this overarching condition.
2. **Target of Decomposition:** The model establishes dependencies from each obligation to the precondition. This demonstrates a clear relationship; however, it does not follow the decomposition criteria as `IE6` is not decomposed into further intentional elements.

### Conclusion for Choice 3:
While this choice introduces valuable structure through the precondition, it does not fully utilize decomposition as required by the criteria.

### Final Recommendation:
After analyzing the three choices based on the criteria provided, we can conclude that:

- Choice 1 best adheres to both decomposition and target criteria, providing a clear structure and interrelation among obligations.
- Choice 2, while straightforward, lacks complexity and does not effectively convey relationships among obligations.
- Choice 3 improves on structure with a precondition but does not fully capitalize on the decomposition of obligations.

Therefore, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria to determine the best domain model.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Criterion 1**: The model correctly decomposes the obligations into separate intentional elements that maintain the same modality (all are classified as "Obligation"). This adheres to the requirement that decomposition is only between intentional elements of the same type and modality.
2. **Criterion 2**: The decomposition from the main obligation (creating a research plan) to the specific obligations (setting out affiliation, defining objectives, etc.) is valid since it targets multiple intentional elements. 

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This model is well-structured and adheres to both criteria.

---

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Criterion 1**: This choice similarly maintains the modality of all intentional elements as "Obligation". However, it does not introduce any preconditions, which could be a missed opportunity to enhance the model's comprehensiveness.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model decomposes the primary obligation into multiple specific obligations, thus complying with the requirement on the target of decomposition.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: While it adheres to the criteria, the lack of preconditions makes it less robust compared to Choice 1.

---

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Criterion 1**: Like the other choices, this one maintains the same modality for all obligations. However, it introduces a precondition as an overarching requirement.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model does create connections between the obligations and the precondition, which meets the requirement that the decomposition must target more than one intentional element.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice introduces a precondition, which adds depth to the model, but it also runs the risk of complicating the structure unnecessarily.

---

**Final Comparison:**
- **Choice 1** has a clear structure, meets both criteria effectively, and doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Choice 2** is straightforward but lacks the additional nuance of preconditions.
- **Choice 3** introduces preconditions but complicates the model without clarity on the necessity of those connections.

Considering the importance of clarity and adherence to the criteria without overcomplicating the model, the best choice is **Choice 1**.

**The best choice is 1.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To analyze the given choices for generating Legal GRL models from law articles while considering the focal actors (Researchers) and adhering to the specified criteria, let's evaluate each choice in detail based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model decomposes the obligation to "create a research plan in writing" (IE1) into four separate obligations (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5). This is valid as it maintains the modality of "Obligation" throughout the decomposition. Thus, it meets Criterion 1.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - IE1 is decomposed into four elements (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5), which satisfies Criterion 2.

Overall, Choice 1 adheres to both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also decomposes the obligation (IE1) into four obligations. This maintains the same modality and type, fulfilling Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Again, IE1 is decomposed into four elements, satisfying Criterion 2.

Choice 2 also adheres to both criteria effectively. However, it does not introduce any preconditions or additional structure, which may limit its expressiveness compared to Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - In this choice, the model includes a precondition (IE6) that encompasses the overall requirement for the research plan, while still maintaining the separate obligations. This demonstrates adherence to Criterion 1, as all intentional elements involved are either obligations or preconditions.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model includes dependencies from each obligation to the precondition (IE6), which is also acceptable under Criterion 2, as it shows that the obligations depend on the fulfillment of the precondition.

This choice introduces a more comprehensive structure by adding the precondition, which can be beneficial in understanding the overall requirement for the research plan.

### Conclusion:
Both Choices 1 and 2 effectively meet the criteria, but Choice 3 enhances the model by introducing a precondition that captures the overarching requirement for the obligations. This added layer of complexity can provide more context and clarity for researchers in understanding the legal requirements. Thus, considering the criteria and the additional value provided in Choice 3:

The best choice is **3**.

In the refined model, I have created additional «Preconditions» to represent the necessary conditions for fulfilling the obligations, thus adhering to the specified constraints. The model now reflects a complete structure, capturing both the obligations and the necessary preconditions.
