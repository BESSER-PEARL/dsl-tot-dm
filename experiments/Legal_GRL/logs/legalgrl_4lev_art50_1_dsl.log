Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

 To analyze the choices based on the provided criteria, we will evaluate each choice for the extraction of atomic statements and preconditions.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts atomic statements but lacks a clear indication of the Consumer's obligations or rights. 
- Criterion 2: There are no clauses starting with "if," so no preconditions are extracted. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts both Tax Authority and Consumer's obligations, but it introduces the modal verb "may," which implies optionality rather than a requirement for the Tax Authority.
- Criterion 2: There are no preconditions extracted for clauses starting with "if." 

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts atomic statements for both the Tax Authority and Consumer, clearly indicating the obligations of both actors.
- Criterion 2: It includes multiple clauses starting with "if," effectively capturing preconditions relevant to the Consumer's liability to pay taxes.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices against the specified criteria, Choice 3 stands out as the most comprehensive and in alignment with the domain's purpose. It effectively captures atomic legal statements and the necessary preconditions. 

The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice does extract atomic statements from the perspective of the Tax Authority. However, it does not consider the Consumer's perspective or any preconditions.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no clauses starting with "if," so preconditions are not addressed.
  
Overall, this choice fails to capture the Consumer's perspective and does not include any preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice includes statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer's perspective, which is good. However, the use of "may" implies discretion rather than obligation, which might not accurately reflect the law.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no preconditions for any clauses, failing to address "if" statements.

Overall, while this choice includes perspectives from both actors, it lacks precision in legal obligation and does not capture preconditions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives, fulfilling the requirement to represent both focal actors.
- **Criterion 2**: It successfully includes preconditions for the Consumer's tax liability, specifically the requirement for the connection to be established.

Overall, this choice comprehensively covers both focal actors and addresses the necessary preconditions.

**Conclusion**: The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice extracts clear atomic statements regarding the obligations of the Tax Authority; however, it does not provide any statements from the perspective of the Consumer.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no clauses starting with "if" to check for preconditions, thus failing to capture any conditional statements.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice captures statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, the use of "may" in the statements for the Tax Authority may imply a lack of obligation, which is less definitive than "shall."
- **Criterion 2**: As with Choice 1, there are no conditional statements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice includes detailed atomic statements for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, making it comprehensive.
- **Criterion 2**: It appropriately includes conditional clauses using "if," capturing the necessary preconditions for the Consumer's liability.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Choice 3 comprehensively addresses both criteria by providing detailed atomic statements from both focal actors and including important conditional clauses. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements extracted focus solely on the Tax Authority, which reflects the obligation to levy taxes. However, they do not clearly indicate the conditions under which the taxes should be levied. 
   - The Consumer is not mentioned, which fails Criterion 1, as it does not provide atomic statements from the perspective of both focal actors.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no "if" clauses present, so Criterion 2 is not applicable here.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This choice does not satisfy the requirements for both focal actors and lacks preconditions, making it less suitable.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice includes statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, which satisfies Criterion 1. However, the use of "may" introduces ambiguity about the obligations of the Tax Authority, which could misrepresent the legal requirements.
   - The statements do not extract clear conditions for the levy or payment of taxes, limiting their effectiveness.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no preconditions extracted for any of the statements, failing Criterion 2.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: While this choice includes perspectives from both actors, it lacks clarity on obligations and does not address preconditions, which makes it less effective than it could be.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice effectively extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. The use of "shall" indicates a clear obligation, satisfying Criterion 1.
   - The Consumer's liability to pay taxes is clearly stated, and the conditions are established in the "if" clauses.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The presence of "if" clauses directly addresses Criterion 2, indicating the conditions under which the Consumer must pay taxes. This makes the model more robust and applicable.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice successfully captures the legal obligations of both focal actors and clearly delineates the conditions, fulfilling both criteria effectively.

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the specified criteria, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice extracts atomic statements effectively from the perspective of the Tax Authority, stating clear obligations. However, it does not consider the Consumer's perspective, which is a significant oversight.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no conditions or clauses starting with "if" that have been extracted, which fails to address this criterion.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives, which is a positive aspect. However, the use of "may" for the Tax Authority's actions introduces ambiguity, suggesting discretion rather than obligation.
- **Criterion 2:** No preconditions are extracted for clauses starting with "if," which does not meet this requirement.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice effectively captures atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives. It clearly states obligations, which is crucial for legal clarity.
- **Criterion 2:** This choice includes preconditions for the Consumer's liability, satisfying the requirement for clauses that start with "if."

### Conclusion:
After analyzing each choice, it is evident that Choice 3 provides the most comprehensive and clear legal statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives while also fulfilling both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is **3**.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The actions are described without preconditions for the first two statements, which is acceptable.
   - However, the last two statements include the phrase "if the connection is established," indicating a precondition, which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two statements are classified correctly as obligations with the modal verb "shall."
   - The last two statements are classified as obligations but fail to meet the requirement of being free of preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The first two actions are described without preconditions, which complies with Criterion 1.
   - The last two statements again include "if the connection is established," which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two statements are appropriately classified as obligations.
   - The last two statements are also classified as obligations but contain preconditions, failing to meet Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The first two actions are described without preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.
   - The last two statements still include "if the connection is established," which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two are correctly classified as obligations.
   - The last two are classified correctly but again include preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All choices fail to fully comply with Criterion 1 as they include preconditions in the last two statements. However, all choices correctly classify the atomic legal statements as obligations. 

Given that all options have similar shortcomings regarding preconditions, and considering that they all have the same content, the best choice based on the structure and clarity of presentation is:

The best choice is 1.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. The first and second statements regarding the Tax Authority's obligations do not have any preconditions, which is good as it aligns with Criterion 1.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer both include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
3. Each statement is classified correctly as either an obligation (for both Tax Authority and Consumer), aligning with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. Similar to Choice 1, the first two statements concerning the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer again include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), violating Criterion 1.
3. All statements are classified correctly, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. The first two statements regarding the Tax Authority meet Criterion 1 as they do not contain any preconditions.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer also include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
3. All statements are correctly classified as obligations, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:

All choices contain statements with obligations for the Tax Authority that meet the criteria. However, all choices also include statements for the Consumer that violate Criterion 1 by including preconditions. Therefore, none of the choices fully meet the criteria. However, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are structurally similar, with the primary difference being formatting. Since they all fail due to the same reason, there isn't a best choice among them.

Nonetheless, given the formatting consistency in Choice 3, it stands out slightly for clarity, despite the violation of criteria:

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions. 
   - **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** are compliant as they do not mention any preconditions. 
   - **Statements 3 and 4** include the precondition "if the connection is established," which is not compliant.
  
2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are also classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions.
   - Statements 1 and 2 do not include preconditions, which is compliant.
   - Statements 3 and 4 again include the precondition "if the connection is established," which makes them non-compliant.

2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions.
   - Statements 1 and 2 do not include preconditions and are compliant.
   - Statements 3 and 4 also include the precondition "if the connection is established," which is non-compliant.

2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of preconditions in the actions related to the Consumer. However, since all choices are identical in this regard, they are similarly flawed. Therefore, none of the choices fulfill the criteria perfectly. 

Despite this, since all choices have the same structure, I would conclude that the best choice is the one least flawed in its format. Since they all fail in the same way, I will select Choice 1 as the best choice due to its clarity in presenting the obligations of the Tax Authority without repeating the same statements. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions described for the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1. However, the actions for the Consumer reference a precondition ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: Each atomic legal statement is classified as either an obligation or a permission. In this case, all actions are classified as obligations, which aligns with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: Similar to Choice 1, the actions for the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions. However, the actions for the Consumer again include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), violating Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: All actions are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions for the Tax Authority correctly do not include preconditions. However, the Consumer actions still reference a precondition ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: All actions are classified as obligations, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
All three choices have similar issues with preconditions in the actions for the Consumer, which violate Criterion 1. However, since Choices 1, 2, and 3 are nearly identical in structure and content, and all fail to completely meet the criteria due to the Consumer's actions including preconditions, they are equally inadequate. 

However, since Choice 2 does not repeat the connection establishment condition as often, it is slightly more streamlined than the others.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): The connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): The connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 1 fails Criterion 2 because it includes atomic statements that classify the consumer's actions with preconditions, which is against the requirement to classify every statement as an obligation or permission without including conditions.

### Choice 2:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 2 also fails Criterion 2 because it includes preconditions for the consumer's obligations, thus not classifying them purely as obligations or permissions.

### Choice 3:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 3 also fails Criterion 2 for the same reasons as Choices 1 and 2. The consumer's obligations are stated with preconditions and do not strictly classify them as obligations or permissions.

### Conclusion

All choices fail to meet the criteria effectively, particularly Criterion 2, which requires that all obligations or permissions be stated without preconditions. However, since Choices 1, 2, and 3 are fundamentally similar in this regard, they do not fulfill the requirement of being ideal models.

Despite this, if a choice must be made, the most consistent extraction of actions related to the Tax Authority without conditions is found in Choices 1, 2, and 3. However, due to the presence of preconditions in consumer obligations, none of the choices fulfill the criteria fully.

Given this analysis, I conclude that **the best choice is 1** (even though it still has the issues mentioned).

Create the model from the perspective of focal actors: Tax Authority and Consumer.

The model is created using the following domain:
The tax is levied on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer, as well as on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

 Let's analyze each choice against the specified criteria in detail.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model has a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is indeed a «Precondition», and the target of the Dependency (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model includes a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a «Precondition», and the target (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model also includes a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a «Precondition», and the target (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Conclusion:
All three choices comply with the established criteria. However, Choices 2 and 3 contain a minor syntactical difference in formatting (the use of commas), but this does not affect the functional correctness of the models. Choice 1 is slightly more streamlined in its representation.

The best choice is 1, as it presents a cleaner model format while still fully adhering to the criteria without any syntactical discrepancies. 

**The best choice is 1.**

 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: The model has a precondition (IE3: "The connection is established") that is an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. This condition acts as the source of a Dependency, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is IE3 (Precondition), and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies the requirement that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements with the same description. Each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: As in Choice 1, there is the precondition IE3 that serves as the source of a Dependency, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency source is IE3 (Precondition), and the target is IE2 (Obligation), which meets the requirement.
3. **Criterion 3**: The model elements are unique and there are no duplications.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes a precondition (IE3) that is an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, serving as the source for a Dependency. Thus, this criterion is satisfied.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency source is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation), which meets the requirement of the target being an Obligation.
3. **Criterion 3**: All intentional elements have unique descriptions, ensuring no duplications exist.

### Conclusion
All choices successfully meet the criteria outlined. However, upon close examination, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are effectively similar in structure and content, differing only in formatting. 

To select the best choice based on clarity and completeness, **Choice 1** stands out due to its straightforward and clean structure, making it easier to comprehend while still fulfilling all the requirements. Hence, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: In this model, **IE3** ("The connection is established") is a **Precondition** and is the source of a **Dependency**, which satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source is **IE3** (Precondition) and the target is **IE2** ("pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") which is an **Obligation**. This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: Each IntentionalElement has a unique description, so there is no duplication. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: Similar to Choice 1, **IE3** is a **Precondition** and serves as the source of a **Dependency**. Criterion 1 is satisfied.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source (**IE3**) is a **Precondition**, and the target (**IE2**) is an **Obligation**, fulfilling Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate descriptions in the IntentionalElements, so Criterion 3 is satisfied.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: **IE3** is again a **Precondition** and serves as the source of a **Dependency**, therefore satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model maintains the same structure where the source is a **Precondition** (**IE3**) and the target is an **Obligation** (**IE2**), satisfying Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicates among IntentionalElements, so Criterion 3 is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
All three choices satisfy the criteria outlined. However, the key difference lies in the formatting and structure of the model. 

- **Choice 1** has a cleaner structure in the model representation, and it does not have extra commas which might cause confusion.
- **Choice 2** has unnecessary commas between Actor definitions which could lead to misinterpretation in parsing.
- **Choice 3** has a similar issue with formatting as Choice 2.

Thus, while all choices are valid according to the criteria, **Choice 1** appears to be the best structured and cleanest representation.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria for the domain model focused on generating Legal GRL models from law articles, specifically from the perspective of the Tax Authority and Consumer while ignoring gas-related regulations.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - **Precondition**: The connection is established (IE3) is indeed classified as a Precondition and is linked as the source of a Dependency to another obligation (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This meets **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplicate descriptions for any of the model elements present. Each intentional element has a unique description.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - The model correctly identifies the connection established (IE3) as a Precondition and links it to the obligation of the Consumer (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This adheres to **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplicate descriptions in this choice. Each intentional element has a unique description as well.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - Similar to the other choices, the model identifies the connection established (IE3) as a Precondition and creates a Dependency to the Consumer's obligation (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This meets **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - This choice also maintains unique descriptions across its elements.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Conclusion:
All three choices adhere to the specified criteria effectively. However, there are minor syntactical differences in how the model elements are structured, especially in terms of formatting and the inclusion of commas. Choice 1 presents a clear and concise format without unnecessary separators, thus making it easier to read and interpret. 

Therefore, after careful consideration of the clarity and structure of the model:

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: The model correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer's obligation (IE2) to pay tax.
   
2. **Dependency**: The model establishes a Dependency between IE3 (Precondition) and IE2 (Obligation), satisfying the requirement that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be an Obligation.

3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicate elements within this choice as each IntentionalElement has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, it correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer’s obligation (IE2).
   
2. **Dependency**: The model establishes the same necessary Dependency as in Choice 1, which complies with the given criteria.

3. **Duplication**: This choice has no duplication of model elements either, as all descriptions are unique.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: This model also correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer's obligation (IE2).
   
2. **Dependency**: The Dependency is established in the same way as in the previous choices, fulfilling the requirement.

3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication present in this choice as well.

### Conclusion:

All three choices effectively meet the criteria specified. They all include a Precondition, establish the necessary Dependency, and avoid duplication of model elements. However, the main difference lies in formatting and clarity. 

- **Choice 1** presents the information in a more compact format, which may be easier to read.
  
- **Choices 2 and 3** are more verbose and have minor differences in the structure (such as commas), but they do not add any significant value over Choice 1.

Taking everything into account, the best choice, considering clarity and conciseness, is:

The best choice is 1.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
The focus of the model is: Ignore the gas related regulation.
Create the model from the perspective of focal actors: Tax Authority and Consumer.

The model is created using the following domain:
The tax is levied on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer, as well as on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*

    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Refine Obligations**: 
   - IE1 (Obligation): "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer" remains the same as there are no preconditions defined that need further breakdown.

2. **Refine Permissions and Preconditions**: 
   - For IE2 (Obligation): "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" is dependent on IE3 (Precondition): "The connection is established". We will refine this precondition using logical propositions:
     - A: The connection is established.

   The propositional formula will be simply:
   - A

   Thus, we will create sub-intentional elements for the precondition:
   - P_A: "The connection is established."

   The structure will be:
   ```
   IE3 is the root (Precondition)
   ```

3. **Connect the original IntentionalElement to the newly created sub IntentionalElements**:
   - As IE3 is a single proposition, it will simply remain as it is.

4. **Contribution Links**: 
   - We don't need new contributions as the original model already conveys the necessary links.

The refined Legal GRL model will be:

```
Model:
    actors = 
        Actor: 
            name: "Tax Authority"
            intentionalElements =

                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The connection is established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE2

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Obligations:**
   - **Tax Authority** shall levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - **Consumer** is liable to pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.

2. **Permissions:** 
   - No permissions specified in the current model.

3. **Preconditions:**
   - The connection is established.

### Propositional Logic Formulas:

1. **Obligation of Tax Authority:**
   - A: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer. 

   Propositional formula: A

2. **Obligation of Consumer:**
   - B: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.
   - C: The connection is established.

   Propositional formula: B if C
   
   This can be expressed as: C -> B (If the connection is established, then the consumer pays tax).

### Syntax Trees:

1. **Tax Authority Obligation Syntax Tree:**
   ```
       A
   ```

2. **Consumer Obligation Syntax Tree:**
   ```
       ->
      /  \
     C    B
   ```

### New Intentional Elements Creation:

1. For **Tax Authority** obligation:
   - IE1: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer. (Obligation)

2. For **Consumer** obligation:
   - IE2: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection. (Obligation)
   - IE3: The connection is established. (Precondition)

### Connections:

1. **Obligation of Tax Authority:**
   - No decomposition needed as it is a single obligation.

2. **Obligation of Consumer:**
   - Decompose into IE2 and IE3 with a Dependency link (C -> B).

### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

```
Model:
    actors = 
        Actor: 
            name: "Tax Authority"
            intentionalElements = 
                IntentionalElement: 
                    id: "IE1"
                    description: "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
                    type: Goal
                    modality: Obligation

    Actor: 
        name: "Consumer"
        intentionalElements = 
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE2"
                description: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The connection is established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE2 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE1
        Contribution: 
            source: IE2
            target: IE1
            level: 100
;
``` 

In this refined model, we maintain the focus on the Tax Authority and Consumer while ensuring all obligations and preconditions are clearly defined and connected as per the specified requirements.

Choice 3:

```

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. For the **Obligation** "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer", we keep it as is since it does not have any preconditions. The propositional logic formula for it is simply:
   - A: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - Formula: A.

2. For the **Obligation** "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" with the precondition "The connection is established", we analyze it as follows:
   - A: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.
   - B: The connection is established.
   - Formula: B → A (If the connection is established, then the consumer pays tax).

### Explanation of Refinements:
- The original obligations are preserved, and new sub-intentional elements are created as needed based on the analysis.
- The contributions and dependencies are established to reflect the logical relationships between the obligations and preconditions.
- The overall structure ensures that the model accurately reflects the legal obligations and their interdependencies while adhering to the specified syntax.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each of the choices based on the provided criteria, focusing on how well they adhere to the specified rules while modeling the legal GRL.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model maintains separate intentional elements for the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer. The obligations and preconditions are correctly categorized and do not violate the decomposition rule.
   - The precondition ("The connection is established") is correctly linked to the obligation of the Consumer.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - Each intentional element has clear, distinct roles, and the decomposition does not occur unless there are multiple elements involved. Here, the obligation to pay tax is appropriately dependent on the established connection.

**Verdict**: Choice 1 adheres well to the criteria.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, the intentional elements are well-defined and categorized. The obligations and preconditions are properly separated.
   - The precondition for the Consumer's obligation is appropriately linked, maintaining the integrity of their relationship.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The Consumer’s obligation to pay tax relies on the precondition of the connection being established, fulfilling the requirement of having more than one intentional element.

**Verdict**: Choice 2 also adheres well to the criteria, mirroring the strengths of Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Choice 3 correctly identifies the obligations and preconditions, but it introduces redundancy by creating sub-intentional elements for the same obligations (e.g., IE1 and IE1_A). This violates the criterion that decomposition should only occur between intentional elements of the same type and modality without unnecessary duplication.
   - While it does maintain clear links among obligations and preconditions, the redundancy introduces complexity that is not warranted.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The connections between obligations and preconditions are still clear, but the addition of extraneous elements (such as IE1_A and IE2_A) complicates the model unnecessarily without providing additional clarity.

**Verdict**: Choice 3 does not conform as well to the criteria due to unnecessary duplications.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria of decomposition and clarity in intentional elements, I conclude that the best choice is Choice 1, as it provides a clear and concise model without unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let’s analyze each choice against the defined criteria and the purpose of the domain modeling.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model maintains the integrity of decomposition, ensuring that the precondition (IE3) and the obligation (IE2) are treated correctly. Preconditions are not decomposed further, respecting Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model correctly identifies that both obligations (IE1 and IE2) and the precondition (IE3) are distinct elements, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition maintains the appropriate intentional elements and their relationships without violating any rules. The model respects the boundaries between different modalities (obligations and preconditions).
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model differentiates between obligations and preconditions without merging them, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Choice 3 introduces a redundant intentional element (IE1_A) that is essentially a duplicate of IE1. This violates Criterion 1 as it unnecessarily complicates the model by introducing two representations of the same obligation.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Although the presence of separate intentional elements is maintained, the introduction of redundancy does not add value and may mislead the understanding of the obligations.

### Conclusion:
Choices 1 and 2 both successfully adhere to the given criteria, maintaining clarity and correctness in the decomposition of obligations and preconditions. Choice 3, however, introduces redundant elements that complicate the model without adding any meaningful distinction. Therefore, the best choice is one of the models that do not introduce such redundancy.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the stated criteria and the given domain description, let's analyze each choice in detail:

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model separates the obligations and preconditions correctly. The Tax Authority's obligation (IE1) is not decomposed further since it has no preconditions. The Consumer's obligation (IE2) is linked to its precondition (IE3). This adheres to Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is correctly done since the Consumer's obligation is dependent on the precondition (IE3), fulfilling Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - The model maintains a clear logical structure with correct dependencies and contributions.

Overall, Choice 1 meets both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations and preconditions are appropriately structured. The obligations are not unnecessarily decomposed, and the precondition (IE3) supports the obligation (IE2), fulfilling Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is valid since the Consumer's obligation is dependent on its precondition, which satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - The model clearly delineates the relationships, maintaining a logical flow.

Choice 2 also fulfills both criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The obligations are presented, but there seems to be unnecessary repetition with the creation of new intentional elements (IE1_A and IE2_A) that do not add value to the model. This could violate Criterion 1 as it introduces redundancy.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is still valid, as the Consumer's obligation relies on the precondition, which meets Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - Although the model maintains logical dependencies, the redundancy introduced with IE1_A and IE2_A complicates the structure without providing additional clarity.

Choice 3 does meet the decomposition criteria; however, it introduces unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria, both Choices 1 and 2 effectively meet the criteria with clear, logical structures. Choice 3, while valid, introduces unnecessary redundancy which complicates the model.

Thus, the best choice is **1**, as it presents a straightforward and clear model without redundancy.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations and preconditions of the same type. The obligation of the Tax Authority and the obligation of the Consumer are presented correctly, with the precondition for the Consumer being a separate intentional element.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model includes multiple intentional elements (IE1 for the Tax Authority and both IE2 and IE3 for the Consumer), satisfying this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also maintains a clear separation of intentional element types and modalities. The obligations are kept distinct from the precondition, ensuring compliance with the decomposition rule.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model features multiple intentional elements (IE1, IE2, and IE3), fulfilling the requirement for more than one intentional element.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This choice also adheres to the decomposition rules, presenting the obligations and preconditions correctly. The obligations are clearly defined and separated from the precondition, which is also correctly categorized as a separate intentional element.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - This choice includes multiple intentional elements as well, maintaining compliance with the requirement for more than one intentional element.

### Conclusion:

All three choices appear to effectively represent the legal obligations and conditions surrounding the Tax Authority and Consumer in the context of electricity supply taxes. They all satisfy the decomposition criteria and adequately address the target of decomposition. 

However, upon closer examination, while they all meet the criteria, **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** are more straightforward in their presentation without introducing unnecessary complexities like additional intentional elements that were not required by the initial statements. 

Both choices are well-structured, but **Choice 2** provides a clearer logical representation with propositional logic and syntax trees, which enhances understanding and clarity.

Therefore, the best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations and preconditions into appropriate intentional elements. The obligations are not mixed with preconditions, adhering to the first criterion.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model includes more than one intentional element for the consumer, as it separates the obligation to pay tax from the precondition of establishing the connection. This meets the second criterion.

Overall, Choice 1 respects both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this model maintains the separation of obligations and preconditions. It does not violate the first criterion by mixing different intentional elements.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The consumer's obligation is decomposed into two elements: the obligation to pay tax and the precondition that the connection must be established. This satisfies the second criterion as well.

Choice 2 also adheres to both criteria perfectly.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This model correctly separates the obligations from the precondition. The obligations are distinct and not intermixed with the preconditions, adhering to the first criterion.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model decomposes the consumer's obligation into two elements (paying tax and the precondition) effectively, thus satisfying the second criterion.

Choice 3 also meets both criteria well.

### Conclusion:
All three choices adhere to the specified criteria. However, they are structurally similar, and no significant advantages or disadvantages are present across them regarding the criteria. 

Given that all choices are compliant, the best choice would be based on clarity and adherence to the model's intent. Choices 1 and 2 are slightly more straightforward in their representation and maintain a clean separation of elements. 

Thus, considering clarity and adherence to the criteria, "The best choice is 1."

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Refine Obligations**: 
   - IE1 (Obligation): "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer" remains the same as there are no preconditions defined that need further breakdown.

2. **Refine Permissions and Preconditions**: 
   - For IE2 (Obligation): "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" is dependent on IE3 (Precondition): "The connection is established". We will refine this precondition using logical propositions:
     - A: The connection is established.

   The propositional formula will be simply:
   - A

   Thus, we will create sub-intentional elements for the precondition:
   - P_A: "The connection is established."

   The structure will be:
   ```
   IE3 is the root (Precondition)
   ```

3. **Connect the original IntentionalElement to the newly created sub IntentionalElements**:
   - As IE3 is a single proposition, it will simply remain as it is.

4. **Contribution Links**: 
   - We don't need new contributions as the original model already conveys the necessary links.

The refined Legal GRL model will be:
