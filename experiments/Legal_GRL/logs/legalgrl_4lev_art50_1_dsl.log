Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

 To analyze the choices based on the provided criteria, we will evaluate each choice for the extraction of atomic statements and preconditions.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts atomic statements but lacks a clear indication of the Consumer's obligations or rights. 
- Criterion 2: There are no clauses starting with "if," so no preconditions are extracted. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts both Tax Authority and Consumer's obligations, but it introduces the modal verb "may," which implies optionality rather than a requirement for the Tax Authority.
- Criterion 2: There are no preconditions extracted for clauses starting with "if." 

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- Criterion 1: This choice extracts atomic statements for both the Tax Authority and Consumer, clearly indicating the obligations of both actors.
- Criterion 2: It includes multiple clauses starting with "if," effectively capturing preconditions relevant to the Consumer's liability to pay taxes.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices against the specified criteria, Choice 3 stands out as the most comprehensive and in alignment with the domain's purpose. It effectively captures atomic legal statements and the necessary preconditions. 

The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice does extract atomic statements from the perspective of the Tax Authority. However, it does not consider the Consumer's perspective or any preconditions.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no clauses starting with "if," so preconditions are not addressed.
  
Overall, this choice fails to capture the Consumer's perspective and does not include any preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice includes statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer's perspective, which is good. However, the use of "may" implies discretion rather than obligation, which might not accurately reflect the law.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no preconditions for any clauses, failing to address "if" statements.

Overall, while this choice includes perspectives from both actors, it lacks precision in legal obligation and does not capture preconditions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives, fulfilling the requirement to represent both focal actors.
- **Criterion 2**: It successfully includes preconditions for the Consumer's tax liability, specifically the requirement for the connection to be established.

Overall, this choice comprehensively covers both focal actors and addresses the necessary preconditions.

**Conclusion**: The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice extracts clear atomic statements regarding the obligations of the Tax Authority; however, it does not provide any statements from the perspective of the Consumer.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no clauses starting with "if" to check for preconditions, thus failing to capture any conditional statements.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice captures statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, the use of "may" in the statements for the Tax Authority may imply a lack of obligation, which is less definitive than "shall."
- **Criterion 2**: As with Choice 1, there are no conditional statements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1**: This choice includes detailed atomic statements for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, making it comprehensive.
- **Criterion 2**: It appropriately includes conditional clauses using "if," capturing the necessary preconditions for the Consumer's liability.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Choice 3 comprehensively addresses both criteria by providing detailed atomic statements from both focal actors and including important conditional clauses. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements extracted focus solely on the Tax Authority, which reflects the obligation to levy taxes. However, they do not clearly indicate the conditions under which the taxes should be levied. 
   - The Consumer is not mentioned, which fails Criterion 1, as it does not provide atomic statements from the perspective of both focal actors.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no "if" clauses present, so Criterion 2 is not applicable here.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This choice does not satisfy the requirements for both focal actors and lacks preconditions, making it less suitable.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice includes statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, which satisfies Criterion 1. However, the use of "may" introduces ambiguity about the obligations of the Tax Authority, which could misrepresent the legal requirements.
   - The statements do not extract clear conditions for the levy or payment of taxes, limiting their effectiveness.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no preconditions extracted for any of the statements, failing Criterion 2.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: While this choice includes perspectives from both actors, it lacks clarity on obligations and does not address preconditions, which makes it less effective than it could be.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice effectively extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. The use of "shall" indicates a clear obligation, satisfying Criterion 1.
   - The Consumer's liability to pay taxes is clearly stated, and the conditions are established in the "if" clauses.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The presence of "if" clauses directly addresses Criterion 2, indicating the conditions under which the Consumer must pay taxes. This makes the model more robust and applicable.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice successfully captures the legal obligations of both focal actors and clearly delineates the conditions, fulfilling both criteria effectively.

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the specified criteria, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
2. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
3. **Tax Authority** must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice extracts atomic statements effectively from the perspective of the Tax Authority, stating clear obligations. However, it does not consider the Consumer's perspective, which is a significant oversight.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no conditions or clauses starting with "if" that have been extracted, which fails to address this criterion.

### Choice 2:
1. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer** (precondition: none).
2. **Tax Authority** (subject) **may** (modal verb) **levy taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).
3. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas or electricity received through their connection** (precondition: none).
4. **Consumer** (subject) **shall** (modal verb) **pay taxes** (action) **on the supply of natural gas received through the connection to a CNG filling station** (precondition: none).

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice extracts atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives, which is a positive aspect. However, the use of "may" for the Tax Authority's actions introduces ambiguity, suggesting discretion rather than obligation.
- **Criterion 2:** No preconditions are extracted for clauses starting with "if," which does not meet this requirement.

### Choice 3:
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
3. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station**.
4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
5. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**. 
6. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection to a CNG filling station** **if** **the connection is established**.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice effectively captures atomic statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives. It clearly states obligations, which is crucial for legal clarity.
- **Criterion 2:** This choice includes preconditions for the Consumer's liability, satisfying the requirement for clauses that start with "if."

### Conclusion:
After analyzing each choice, it is evident that Choice 3 provides the most comprehensive and clear legal statements from both the Tax Authority and Consumer perspectives while also fulfilling both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is **3**.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The actions are described without preconditions for the first two statements, which is acceptable.
   - However, the last two statements include the phrase "if the connection is established," indicating a precondition, which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two statements are classified correctly as obligations with the modal verb "shall."
   - The last two statements are classified as obligations but fail to meet the requirement of being free of preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The first two actions are described without preconditions, which complies with Criterion 1.
   - The last two statements again include "if the connection is established," which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two statements are appropriately classified as obligations.
   - The last two statements are also classified as obligations but contain preconditions, failing to meet Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. **Description of Actions**:
   - The first two actions are described without preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.
   - The last two statements still include "if the connection is established," which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The first two are correctly classified as obligations.
   - The last two are classified correctly but again include preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All choices fail to fully comply with Criterion 1 as they include preconditions in the last two statements. However, all choices correctly classify the atomic legal statements as obligations. 

Given that all options have similar shortcomings regarding preconditions, and considering that they all have the same content, the best choice based on the structure and clarity of presentation is:

The best choice is 1.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. The first and second statements regarding the Tax Authority's obligations do not have any preconditions, which is good as it aligns with Criterion 1.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer both include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
3. Each statement is classified correctly as either an obligation (for both Tax Authority and Consumer), aligning with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. Similar to Choice 1, the first two statements concerning the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer again include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), violating Criterion 1.
3. All statements are classified correctly, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. The first two statements regarding the Tax Authority meet Criterion 1 as they do not contain any preconditions.
2. The third and fourth statements for the Consumer also include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
3. All statements are correctly classified as obligations, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:

All choices contain statements with obligations for the Tax Authority that meet the criteria. However, all choices also include statements for the Consumer that violate Criterion 1 by including preconditions. Therefore, none of the choices fully meet the criteria. However, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are structurally similar, with the primary difference being formatting. Since they all fail due to the same reason, there isn't a best choice among them.

Nonetheless, given the formatting consistency in Choice 3, it stands out slightly for clarity, despite the violation of criteria:

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions. 
   - **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** are compliant as they do not mention any preconditions. 
   - **Statements 3 and 4** include the precondition "if the connection is established," which is not compliant.
  
2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are also classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions.
   - Statements 1 and 2 do not include preconditions, which is compliant.
   - Statements 3 and 4 again include the precondition "if the connection is established," which makes them non-compliant.

2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions.
   - Statements 1 and 2 do not include preconditions and are compliant.
   - Statements 3 and 4 also include the precondition "if the connection is established," which is non-compliant.

2. **Criterion 2:** Every atomic legal statement should be classified as either an obligation or a permission.
   - Statements 1 and 2 are classified correctly as obligations.
   - Statements 3 and 4 are classified as obligations but incorrectly include preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of preconditions in the actions related to the Consumer. However, since all choices are identical in this regard, they are similarly flawed. Therefore, none of the choices fulfill the criteria perfectly. 

Despite this, since all choices have the same structure, I would conclude that the best choice is the one least flawed in its format. Since they all fail in the same way, I will select Choice 1 as the best choice due to its clarity in presenting the obligations of the Tax Authority without repeating the same statements. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions described for the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions, which aligns with Criterion 1. However, the actions for the Consumer reference a precondition ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: Each atomic legal statement is classified as either an obligation or a permission. In this case, all actions are classified as obligations, which aligns with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: Similar to Choice 1, the actions for the Tax Authority do not include any preconditions. However, the actions for the Consumer again include preconditions ("if the connection is established"), violating Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: All actions are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions for the Tax Authority correctly do not include preconditions. However, the Consumer actions still reference a precondition ("if the connection is established"), which violates Criterion 1.
2. **Classification**: All actions are classified as obligations, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
All three choices have similar issues with preconditions in the actions for the Consumer, which violate Criterion 1. However, since Choices 1, 2, and 3 are nearly identical in structure and content, and all fail to completely meet the criteria due to the Consumer's actions including preconditions, they are equally inadequate. 

However, since Choice 2 does not repeat the connection establishment condition as often, it is slightly more streamlined than the others.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): The connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): The connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 1 fails Criterion 2 because it includes atomic statements that classify the consumer's actions with preconditions, which is against the requirement to classify every statement as an obligation or permission without including conditions.

### Choice 2:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 2 also fails Criterion 2 because it includes preconditions for the consumer's obligations, thus not classifying them purely as obligations or permissions.

### Choice 3:

1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**. 
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

2. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy tax** **on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer**.
   - Actor: Tax Authority
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - Precondition(s): None

3. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of electricity received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

4. **Consumer** **is liable** **to pay tax** **on the supply of natural gas received via a connection** **if** **the connection is established**.
   - Actor: Consumer
   - Modal Verb: is liable
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): pay tax on the supply of natural gas received via a connection
   - Precondition(s): the connection is established

**Analysis**: 
- Choice 3 also fails Criterion 2 for the same reasons as Choices 1 and 2. The consumer's obligations are stated with preconditions and do not strictly classify them as obligations or permissions.

### Conclusion

All choices fail to meet the criteria effectively, particularly Criterion 2, which requires that all obligations or permissions be stated without preconditions. However, since Choices 1, 2, and 3 are fundamentally similar in this regard, they do not fulfill the requirement of being ideal models.

Despite this, if a choice must be made, the most consistent extraction of actions related to the Tax Authority without conditions is found in Choices 1, 2, and 3. However, due to the presence of preconditions in consumer obligations, none of the choices fulfill the criteria fully.

Given this analysis, I conclude that **the best choice is 1** (even though it still has the issues mentioned).

Create the model from the perspective of focal actors: Tax Authority and Consumer.

The model is created using the following domain:
The tax is levied on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer, as well as on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

 Let's analyze each choice against the specified criteria in detail.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model has a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is indeed a «Precondition», and the target of the Dependency (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model includes a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a «Precondition», and the target (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The model also includes a «Precondition» (IE3: "The connection is established") that serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency (IE3) is a «Precondition», and the target (IE2: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") is an «Obligation».
3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications of model elements with the same description.

### Conclusion:
All three choices comply with the established criteria. However, Choices 2 and 3 contain a minor syntactical difference in formatting (the use of commas), but this does not affect the functional correctness of the models. Choice 1 is slightly more streamlined in its representation.

The best choice is 1, as it presents a cleaner model format while still fully adhering to the criteria without any syntactical discrepancies. 

**The best choice is 1.**

 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: The model has a precondition (IE3: "The connection is established") that is an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. This condition acts as the source of a Dependency, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is IE3 (Precondition), and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies the requirement that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be either an Obligation or a Permission.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements with the same description. Each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: As in Choice 1, there is the precondition IE3 that serves as the source of a Dependency, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency source is IE3 (Precondition), and the target is IE2 (Obligation), which meets the requirement.
3. **Criterion 3**: The model elements are unique and there are no duplications.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes a precondition (IE3) that is an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, serving as the source for a Dependency. Thus, this criterion is satisfied.
2. **Criterion 2**: The Dependency source is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation), which meets the requirement of the target being an Obligation.
3. **Criterion 3**: All intentional elements have unique descriptions, ensuring no duplications exist.

### Conclusion
All choices successfully meet the criteria outlined. However, upon close examination, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are effectively similar in structure and content, differing only in formatting. 

To select the best choice based on clarity and completeness, **Choice 1** stands out due to its straightforward and clean structure, making it easier to comprehend while still fulfilling all the requirements. Hence, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: In this model, **IE3** ("The connection is established") is a **Precondition** and is the source of a **Dependency**, which satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source is **IE3** (Precondition) and the target is **IE2** ("pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection") which is an **Obligation**. This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: Each IntentionalElement has a unique description, so there is no duplication. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: Similar to Choice 1, **IE3** is a **Precondition** and serves as the source of a **Dependency**. Criterion 1 is satisfied.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source (**IE3**) is a **Precondition**, and the target (**IE2**) is an **Obligation**, fulfilling Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate descriptions in the IntentionalElements, so Criterion 3 is satisfied.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: **IE3** is again a **Precondition** and serves as the source of a **Dependency**, therefore satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model maintains the same structure where the source is a **Precondition** (**IE3**) and the target is an **Obligation** (**IE2**), satisfying Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicates among IntentionalElements, so Criterion 3 is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
All three choices satisfy the criteria outlined. However, the key difference lies in the formatting and structure of the model. 

- **Choice 1** has a cleaner structure in the model representation, and it does not have extra commas which might cause confusion.
- **Choice 2** has unnecessary commas between Actor definitions which could lead to misinterpretation in parsing.
- **Choice 3** has a similar issue with formatting as Choice 2.

Thus, while all choices are valid according to the criteria, **Choice 1** appears to be the best structured and cleanest representation.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria for the domain model focused on generating Legal GRL models from law articles, specifically from the perspective of the Tax Authority and Consumer while ignoring gas-related regulations.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - **Precondition**: The connection is established (IE3) is indeed classified as a Precondition and is linked as the source of a Dependency to another obligation (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This meets **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplicate descriptions for any of the model elements present. Each intentional element has a unique description.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - The model correctly identifies the connection established (IE3) as a Precondition and links it to the obligation of the Consumer (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This adheres to **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplicate descriptions in this choice. Each intentional element has a unique description as well.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**:
   - Similar to the other choices, the model identifies the connection established (IE3) as a Precondition and creates a Dependency to the Consumer's obligation (pay tax on the supply of electricity).
   - This meets **Criterion 1** and **Criterion 2**.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - This choice also maintains unique descriptions across its elements.
   - This satisfies **Criterion 3**.

### Conclusion:
All three choices adhere to the specified criteria effectively. However, there are minor syntactical differences in how the model elements are structured, especially in terms of formatting and the inclusion of commas. Choice 1 presents a clear and concise format without unnecessary separators, thus making it easier to read and interpret. 

Therefore, after careful consideration of the clarity and structure of the model:

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: The model correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer's obligation (IE2) to pay tax.
   
2. **Dependency**: The model establishes a Dependency between IE3 (Precondition) and IE2 (Obligation), satisfying the requirement that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be an Obligation.

3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicate elements within this choice as each IntentionalElement has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, it correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer’s obligation (IE2).
   
2. **Dependency**: The model establishes the same necessary Dependency as in Choice 1, which complies with the given criteria.

3. **Duplication**: This choice has no duplication of model elements either, as all descriptions are unique.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: This model also correctly identifies "The connection is established" as a Precondition (IE3) for the Consumer's obligation (IE2).
   
2. **Dependency**: The Dependency is established in the same way as in the previous choices, fulfilling the requirement.

3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication present in this choice as well.

### Conclusion:

All three choices effectively meet the criteria specified. They all include a Precondition, establish the necessary Dependency, and avoid duplication of model elements. However, the main difference lies in formatting and clarity. 

- **Choice 1** presents the information in a more compact format, which may be easier to read.
  
- **Choices 2 and 3** are more verbose and have minor differences in the structure (such as commas), but they do not add any significant value over Choice 1.

Taking everything into account, the best choice, considering clarity and conciseness, is:

The best choice is 1.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
The focus of the model is: Ignore the gas related regulation.
Create the model from the perspective of focal actors: Tax Authority and Consumer.

The model is created using the following domain:
The tax is levied on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer, as well as on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*

    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Refine Obligations**: 
   - IE1 (Obligation): "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer" remains the same as there are no preconditions defined that need further breakdown.

2. **Refine Permissions and Preconditions**: 
   - For IE2 (Obligation): "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" is dependent on IE3 (Precondition): "The connection is established". We will refine this precondition using logical propositions:
     - A: The connection is established.

   The propositional formula will be simply:
   - A

   Thus, we will create sub-intentional elements for the precondition:
   - P_A: "The connection is established."

   The structure will be:
   ```
   IE3 is the root (Precondition)
   ```

3. **Connect the original IntentionalElement to the newly created sub IntentionalElements**:
   - As IE3 is a single proposition, it will simply remain as it is.

4. **Contribution Links**: 
   - We don't need new contributions as the original model already conveys the necessary links.

The refined Legal GRL model will be:

```
Model:
    actors = 
        Actor: 
            name: "Tax Authority"
            intentionalElements =

                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The connection is established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE2

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Obligations:**
   - **Tax Authority** shall levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - **Consumer** is liable to pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.

2. **Permissions:** 
   - No permissions specified in the current model.

3. **Preconditions:**
   - The connection is established.

### Propositional Logic Formulas:

1. **Obligation of Tax Authority:**
   - A: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer. 

   Propositional formula: A

2. **Obligation of Consumer:**
   - B: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.
   - C: The connection is established.

   Propositional formula: B if C
   
   This can be expressed as: C -> B (If the connection is established, then the consumer pays tax).

### Syntax Trees:

1. **Tax Authority Obligation Syntax Tree:**
   ```
       A
   ```

2. **Consumer Obligation Syntax Tree:**
   ```
       ->
      /  \
     C    B
   ```

### New Intentional Elements Creation:

1. For **Tax Authority** obligation:
   - IE1: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer. (Obligation)

2. For **Consumer** obligation:
   - IE2: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection. (Obligation)
   - IE3: The connection is established. (Precondition)

### Connections:

1. **Obligation of Tax Authority:**
   - No decomposition needed as it is a single obligation.

2. **Obligation of Consumer:**
   - Decompose into IE2 and IE3 with a Dependency link (C -> B).

### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

```
Model:
    actors = 
        Actor: 
            name: "Tax Authority"
            intentionalElements = 
                IntentionalElement: 
                    id: "IE1"
                    description: "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
                    type: Goal
                    modality: Obligation

    Actor: 
        name: "Consumer"
        intentionalElements = 
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE2"
                description: "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The connection is established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE2 
        Dependency: 
            source: IE3
            target: IE1
        Contribution: 
            source: IE2
            target: IE1
            level: 100
;
``` 

In this refined model, we maintain the focus on the Tax Authority and Consumer while ensuring all obligations and preconditions are clearly defined and connected as per the specified requirements.

Choice 3:

```

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. For the **Obligation** "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer", we keep it as is since it does not have any preconditions. The propositional logic formula for it is simply:
   - A: Tax Authority levies tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - Formula: A.

2. For the **Obligation** "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" with the precondition "The connection is established", we analyze it as follows:
   - A: Consumer pays tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection.
   - B: The connection is established.
   - Formula: B → A (If the connection is established, then the consumer pays tax).

### Explanation of Refinements:
- The original obligations are preserved, and new sub-intentional elements are created as needed based on the analysis.
- The contributions and dependencies are established to reflect the logical relationships between the obligations and preconditions.
- The overall structure ensures that the model accurately reflects the legal obligations and their interdependencies while adhering to the specified syntax.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each of the choices based on the provided criteria, focusing on how well they adhere to the specified rules while modeling the legal GRL.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model maintains separate intentional elements for the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer. The obligations and preconditions are correctly categorized and do not violate the decomposition rule.
   - The precondition ("The connection is established") is correctly linked to the obligation of the Consumer.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - Each intentional element has clear, distinct roles, and the decomposition does not occur unless there are multiple elements involved. Here, the obligation to pay tax is appropriately dependent on the established connection.

**Verdict**: Choice 1 adheres well to the criteria.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, the intentional elements are well-defined and categorized. The obligations and preconditions are properly separated.
   - The precondition for the Consumer's obligation is appropriately linked, maintaining the integrity of their relationship.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The Consumer’s obligation to pay tax relies on the precondition of the connection being established, fulfilling the requirement of having more than one intentional element.

**Verdict**: Choice 2 also adheres well to the criteria, mirroring the strengths of Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Choice 3 correctly identifies the obligations and preconditions, but it introduces redundancy by creating sub-intentional elements for the same obligations (e.g., IE1 and IE1_A). This violates the criterion that decomposition should only occur between intentional elements of the same type and modality without unnecessary duplication.
   - While it does maintain clear links among obligations and preconditions, the redundancy introduces complexity that is not warranted.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The connections between obligations and preconditions are still clear, but the addition of extraneous elements (such as IE1_A and IE2_A) complicates the model unnecessarily without providing additional clarity.

**Verdict**: Choice 3 does not conform as well to the criteria due to unnecessary duplications.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria of decomposition and clarity in intentional elements, I conclude that the best choice is Choice 1, as it provides a clear and concise model without unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let’s analyze each choice against the defined criteria and the purpose of the domain modeling.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model maintains the integrity of decomposition, ensuring that the precondition (IE3) and the obligation (IE2) are treated correctly. Preconditions are not decomposed further, respecting Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model correctly identifies that both obligations (IE1 and IE2) and the precondition (IE3) are distinct elements, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition maintains the appropriate intentional elements and their relationships without violating any rules. The model respects the boundaries between different modalities (obligations and preconditions).
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model differentiates between obligations and preconditions without merging them, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Choice 3 introduces a redundant intentional element (IE1_A) that is essentially a duplicate of IE1. This violates Criterion 1 as it unnecessarily complicates the model by introducing two representations of the same obligation.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Although the presence of separate intentional elements is maintained, the introduction of redundancy does not add value and may mislead the understanding of the obligations.

### Conclusion:
Choices 1 and 2 both successfully adhere to the given criteria, maintaining clarity and correctness in the decomposition of obligations and preconditions. Choice 3, however, introduces redundant elements that complicate the model without adding any meaningful distinction. Therefore, the best choice is one of the models that do not introduce such redundancy.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the stated criteria and the given domain description, let's analyze each choice in detail:

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The model separates the obligations and preconditions correctly. The Tax Authority's obligation (IE1) is not decomposed further since it has no preconditions. The Consumer's obligation (IE2) is linked to its precondition (IE3). This adheres to Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is correctly done since the Consumer's obligation is dependent on the precondition (IE3), fulfilling Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - The model maintains a clear logical structure with correct dependencies and contributions.

Overall, Choice 1 meets both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations and preconditions are appropriately structured. The obligations are not unnecessarily decomposed, and the precondition (IE3) supports the obligation (IE2), fulfilling Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is valid since the Consumer's obligation is dependent on its precondition, which satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - The model clearly delineates the relationships, maintaining a logical flow.

Choice 2 also fulfills both criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criteria**: 
   - The obligations are presented, but there seems to be unnecessary repetition with the creation of new intentional elements (IE1_A and IE2_A) that do not add value to the model. This could violate Criterion 1 as it introduces redundancy.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition is still valid, as the Consumer's obligation relies on the precondition, which meets Criterion 2.

3. **Logical Structure**: 
   - Although the model maintains logical dependencies, the redundancy introduced with IE1_A and IE2_A complicates the structure without providing additional clarity.

Choice 3 does meet the decomposition criteria; however, it introduces unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria, both Choices 1 and 2 effectively meet the criteria with clear, logical structures. Choice 3, while valid, introduces unnecessary redundancy which complicates the model.

Thus, the best choice is **1**, as it presents a straightforward and clear model without redundancy.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations and preconditions of the same type. The obligation of the Tax Authority and the obligation of the Consumer are presented correctly, with the precondition for the Consumer being a separate intentional element.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model includes multiple intentional elements (IE1 for the Tax Authority and both IE2 and IE3 for the Consumer), satisfying this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also maintains a clear separation of intentional element types and modalities. The obligations are kept distinct from the precondition, ensuring compliance with the decomposition rule.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model features multiple intentional elements (IE1, IE2, and IE3), fulfilling the requirement for more than one intentional element.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This choice also adheres to the decomposition rules, presenting the obligations and preconditions correctly. The obligations are clearly defined and separated from the precondition, which is also correctly categorized as a separate intentional element.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - This choice includes multiple intentional elements as well, maintaining compliance with the requirement for more than one intentional element.

### Conclusion:

All three choices appear to effectively represent the legal obligations and conditions surrounding the Tax Authority and Consumer in the context of electricity supply taxes. They all satisfy the decomposition criteria and adequately address the target of decomposition. 

However, upon closer examination, while they all meet the criteria, **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** are more straightforward in their presentation without introducing unnecessary complexities like additional intentional elements that were not required by the initial statements. 

Both choices are well-structured, but **Choice 2** provides a clearer logical representation with propositional logic and syntax trees, which enhances understanding and clarity.

Therefore, the best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations and preconditions into appropriate intentional elements. The obligations are not mixed with preconditions, adhering to the first criterion.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model includes more than one intentional element for the consumer, as it separates the obligation to pay tax from the precondition of establishing the connection. This meets the second criterion.

Overall, Choice 1 respects both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this model maintains the separation of obligations and preconditions. It does not violate the first criterion by mixing different intentional elements.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The consumer's obligation is decomposed into two elements: the obligation to pay tax and the precondition that the connection must be established. This satisfies the second criterion as well.

Choice 2 also adheres to both criteria perfectly.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This model correctly separates the obligations from the precondition. The obligations are distinct and not intermixed with the preconditions, adhering to the first criterion.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The model decomposes the consumer's obligation into two elements (paying tax and the precondition) effectively, thus satisfying the second criterion.

Choice 3 also meets both criteria well.

### Conclusion:
All three choices adhere to the specified criteria. However, they are structurally similar, and no significant advantages or disadvantages are present across them regarding the criteria. 

Given that all choices are compliant, the best choice would be based on clarity and adherence to the model's intent. Choices 1 and 2 are slightly more straightforward in their representation and maintain a clean separation of elements. 

Thus, considering clarity and adherence to the criteria, "The best choice is 1."

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Refine Obligations**: 
   - IE1 (Obligation): "levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer" remains the same as there are no preconditions defined that need further breakdown.

2. **Refine Permissions and Preconditions**: 
   - For IE2 (Obligation): "pay tax on the supply of electricity received via a connection" is dependent on IE3 (Precondition): "The connection is established". We will refine this precondition using logical propositions:
     - A: The connection is established.

   The propositional formula will be simply:
   - A

   Thus, we will create sub-intentional elements for the precondition:
   - P_A: "The connection is established."

   The structure will be:
   ```
   IE3 is the root (Precondition)
   ```

3. **Connect the original IntentionalElement to the newly created sub IntentionalElements**:
   - As IE3 is a single proposition, it will simply remain as it is.

4. **Contribution Links**: 
   - We don't need new contributions as the original model already conveys the necessary links.

The refined Legal GRL model will be:

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
3. The Consumer must provide payment for the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
4. The Consumer must provide payment for the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** The statements capture obligations for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, the focus on gas-related regulation (particularly with CNG) goes against the requirement to ignore such regulations.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no preconditions extracted for 'if' clauses, as there are no conditional statements present.

### Choice 2:
1. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
3. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
4. The Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity as a condition of receiving the service.
5. The Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas as a condition of receiving the service.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice captures relevant obligations, but it incorrectly includes the gas supply via a connection to the consumer, which is not allowed according to the focus of the model. The inclusion of the CNG filling station also contradicts the requirement to ignore gas-related regulation.
- **Criterion 2:** There are conditional statements present, but they are not related to the original article's preconditions, as the article does not imply conditions on payment for gas.

### Choice 3:
1. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
3. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
4. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
5. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station. 
6. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** While this choice presents clear obligations, it includes irrelevant regulations regarding natural gas, including connections to consumers and CNG filling stations, which violates the purpose to ignore gas-related regulation.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no conditional statements present in the model, failing to capture any preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All choices have shortcomings, primarily in their inclusion of gas-related regulations, which contradicts the model's focus. However, Choice 2 stands out for its explicit mention of conditions related to tax payment, despite still including gas-related regulations.

The best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
3. The Consumer must provide payment for the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
4. The Consumer must provide payment for the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** The statements do not fully capture the necessary atomic statements for the Consumer, particularly regarding the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer. Additionally, the focus on CNG filling stations is not relevant to the task of ignoring gas-related regulation.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no statements that begin with "if," which means there are no preconditions extracted for any clauses.

### Choice 2:
1. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
3. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
4. The Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity as a condition of receiving the service.
5. The Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas as a condition of receiving the service.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice effectively captures atomic statements from the perspective of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, it still includes a tax on supply to a CNG filling station, which should be ignored.
- **Criterion 2:** The phrasing "as a condition of receiving the service" indicates a conditional relationship, which aligns with the requirement to extract preconditions.

### Choice 3:
1. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
2. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
3. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
4. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
5. The Tax Authority must levy tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
6. The Consumer must pay tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, this choice includes unnecessary statements regarding CNG filling stations, which should be ignored. It does provide atomic statements relevant to the Consumer and Tax Authority.
- **Criterion 2:** There are no conditional statements that begin with "if," missing the opportunity to represent preconditions.

### Conclusion:
Considering all criteria, Choice 2 is the most effective as it captures relevant atomic statements from both the Tax Authority's and the Consumer's perspectives while indicating conditional relationships. Although it does not fully ignore gas-related regulations as specified, it does a better job of aligning with the criteria than the other choices.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. The first statement correctly identifies the Tax Authority's obligation to levy a tax on the supply of electricity to the consumer. This aligns with Criterion 1.
2. The second statement, however, states that a tax must be levied on the supply of natural gas via a CNG filling station, which is outside the scope of our focus (ignoring gas-related regulation).
3. The third statement accurately reflects the Consumer's obligation to pay tax on the supply of electricity. This also aligns with Criterion 1.
4. The fourth statement includes the gas-related regulation, which should be ignored.
5. This choice does not extract any preconditions for clauses that start with "if," thus failing to meet Criterion 2.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** Poor choice due to inclusion of irrelevant gas-related tax statements and lack of preconditions.

---

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. The first statement correctly identifies the Tax Authority's obligation to levy a tax on electricity, aligning with Criterion 1.
2. The second statement introduces the tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer, which should be ignored.
3. The third statement again mentions the tax on natural gas via a CNG filling station, which is outside our focus.
4. The fourth and fifth statements imply a condition of receiving the service, which brings in a form of precondition, partially addressing Criterion 2.
5. However, the inclusion of gas-related taxation means this choice cannot fully meet the focus requirement.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** Better than Choice 1 but still includes irrelevant gas-related tax statements.

---

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. The first statement correctly captures the Tax Authority's obligation for electricity, meeting Criterion 1.
2. The second statement includes the tax on natural gas via a connection to the consumer, which should be ignored.
3. The third statement accurately reflects the Consumer's obligation to pay for electricity, aligning with Criterion 1.
4. The fourth statement introduces the gas-related tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer, which is outside our focus.
5. The fifth statement again mentions tax on natural gas via a CNG filling station. 
6. The Consumer's obligation regarding natural gas via a CNG filling station is also included, which is irrelevant.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice captures too much irrelevant gas-related regulation and does not extract any preconditions.

---

Overall, all choices contain significant issues with the relevance of the extracted statements regarding gas regulation. However, **Choice 2** has slightly better alignment with the criteria, particularly in terms of conditions related to the consumer's payment. 

Thus, the best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To analyze the choices in detail, we will consider the criteria outlined and how well each choice meets these criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The first statement is relevant, as it pertains to the Tax Authority and aligns with the requirement to levy taxes on electricity.
   - The second statement includes a gas-related regulation (CNG filling station), which the domain model aims to ignore; thus, it does not meet the requirement.
   - The third and fourth statements also include gas regulations, which are not to be included.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no clauses that start with "if" in this choice, meaning that no preconditions are extracted.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The first statement is relevant and appropriate for the Tax Authority.
   - The second statement incorrectly includes a gas-related regulation (natural gas via a connection to the consumer), which should be excluded.
   - The third statement also includes a tax on natural gas via a CNG filling station, which is to be ignored.
   - The fourth and fifth statements appropriately frame the Consumer’s obligation to pay taxes, but they still incorporate gas-related regulations.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The statements regarding the Consumer's payment conditions can be construed as implied preconditions, but do not explicitly start with "if," which is less than ideal.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The first statement is relevant and clearly focuses on the Tax Authority's duty regarding electricity.
   - The second statement wrongly includes a gas-related regulation (natural gas via a connection to the consumer), which should be excluded.
   - The third statement focuses on the Consumer’s obligation regarding electricity, which is appropriate.
   - The fourth statement also mentions natural gas, which should be excluded.
   - The fifth statement includes a gas regulation related to CNG filling stations, which should be ignored.
   - The sixth statement incorrectly includes a gas-related regulation (natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station).

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Similar to the other choices, this choice does not include any explicit "if" clauses, so preconditions are not extracted.

### Conclusion:
All three choices include references to gas-related regulations that are supposed to be ignored, with none effectively isolating the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer solely from the perspective of electricity supply. However, Choice 2, while still including gas references, does a better job of framing the Consumer's responsibilities in terms of service conditions. 

Ultimately, none of the choices perfectly meet the criteria, but based on the analysis, **Choice 2** stands out slightly as it attempts to contextualize the Consumer's obligations more clearly.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:**
   - **Statement 1**: Correctly states the Tax Authority's obligation regarding electricity.
   - **Statement 2**: While it states the obligation regarding natural gas at a CNG filling station, it does not align with the focus of ignoring gas-related regulations.
   - **Statement 3**: Correctly identifies the Consumer's obligation for electricity.
   - **Statement 4**: Similar to Statement 2, it addresses a gas-related regulation which should be ignored.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no statements that begin with "if", thus failing to extract any preconditions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:**
   - **Statement 1**: Correctly states the Tax Authority's obligation regarding electricity.
   - **Statement 2**: Addresses the Tax Authority's obligation related to natural gas via a connection to the consumer. This is not relevant as we are supposed to ignore gas-related regulations.
   - **Statement 3**: Correctly addresses the Tax Authority's obligation at a CNG filling station, which should be ignored.
   - **Statement 4**: Correctly states the Consumer's obligation for electricity but does so in a conditional manner, which is good.
   - **Statement 5**: Also correctly states the Consumer's obligation for natural gas but introduces a condition, which is irrelevant since it pertains to gas.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The statements regarding payment (4 and 5) introduce conditions but are primarily focused on natural gas, which we want to ignore.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:**
   - **Statement 1**: Correctly states the Tax Authority's obligation regarding electricity.
   - **Statement 2**: Addresses the Tax Authority's obligation related to natural gas, which must be ignored.
   - **Statement 3**: Correctly states the Consumer's obligation for electricity.
   - **Statement 4**: Addresses the Consumer's obligation related to natural gas, which should also be ignored.
   - **Statement 5**: Addresses the Tax Authority's obligation regarding natural gas at a CNG filling station, which should be ignored.
   - **Statement 6**: Addresses the Consumer's obligation regarding natural gas at a CNG filling station, which should be ignored.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no statements beginning with "if", thus failing to extract any preconditions.

### Conclusion:
All choices contain references to gas-related regulations which should be ignored as per the focus of the model. However, **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** contain fewer gas-related statements compared to **Choice 3**. In particular, **Choice 2** includes conditional payment obligations, which aligns with extracting preconditions, even though they pertain to gas.

However, since the primary focus is to generate statements that are relevant to the focal actors while ignoring gas-related regulations, **Choice 2** is the most balanced option, providing relevant conditions for the Consumer regarding electricity while still mentioning the gas-related obligations.

Therefore, the best choice is **2**.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Criterion 1**: The descriptions of actions do not include preconditions, as all entries indicate "Precondition(s): None."
- **Criterion 2**: Each atomic statement is correctly classified as an obligation.
  
However, the statements regarding the Consumer's obligation to pay the tax on natural gas include the phrase "as a condition of receiving the service," which implies a precondition. This violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 2:
- **Criterion 1**: The format uses "N/A" to indicate that there are no preconditions. This is acceptable, although "None" would be clearer.
- **Criterion 2**: Each statement is classified as an obligation.
  
However, the Consumer's obligations still include the phrase "as a condition of receiving the service," which implies a precondition. This also violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
- **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 2, it uses "N/A" to indicate the absence of preconditions. This is acceptable but could be clearer if stated as "None."
- **Criterion 2**: Each statement is classified as an obligation.
  
The same issue arises here with the Consumer's obligations. The phrases "as a condition of receiving the service" imply preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All choices have similar issues with the Consumer's obligations, as they reference conditions that imply preconditions. However, Choice 1 explicitly states "None" for preconditions, which is clearer than "N/A" used in Choices 2 and 3. Despite the implied preconditions in the Consumer's obligations, the clearer presentation in Choice 1 makes it preferable.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The description of actions does not include any preconditions. This is satisfied as all actions are presented independently.
2. **Criterion 2**: Every atomic legal statement is classified as an obligation, which is appropriate given the context of tax regulations.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, the descriptions of actions do not include any preconditions, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All statements are classified as obligations, but the description for the Consumer includes a precondition: "as a condition of receiving the service." This violates the criterion since it implies a precondition in the action.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Like the previous choices, actions are described without preconditions, adhering to the requirement.
2. **Criterion 2**: All statements are classified as obligations. However, the actions for the Consumer are still stated with a precondition: "as a condition of receiving the service," which violates the criterion.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, the best fit for the domain model is **Choice 1**, as it meets both criteria effectively without introducing any preconditions in the description of actions.

The best choice is 1.

2. **Criterion 2:** All atomic statements are obligations. However, the phrases "as a condition of receiving the service" indicate a precondition for the Consumer’s actions, which violates the criteria.

### Choice 3
1. **Criterion 1:** The actions are described without preconditions, hence this choice is compliant.
2. **Criterion 2:** All atomic statements are classified as obligations. However, the phrases regarding the Consumer’s obligations, specifically for natural gas, still imply a precondition through the wording "as a condition of receiving the service".

### Conclusion
All choices have shortcomings regarding the presence of preconditions in the Consumer's obligations. However, Choice 1 and Choice 2 explicitly mention "as a condition of receiving the service," which directly contradicts the criteria, while Choice 3 does not include these phrases. Thus, while none of the choices are perfect, Choice 3 is the least problematic as it adheres best to the criteria. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
- **Action(s):** The actions are clearly stated without including any preconditions. This meets Criterion 1.
- **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2. However, the phrases "as a condition of receiving the service" in the obligations for the Consumer imply a precondition.
  
### Choice 2:
- **Action(s):** The actions are described without mentioning any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
- **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations. However, the actions for the Consumer still include the phrase "as a condition of receiving the service," which implies a precondition and fails Criterion 2.

### Choice 3:
- **Action(s):** The actions are once again articulated without preconditions, fulfilling Criterion 1.
- **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations. However, the Consumer obligations still include the phrase "as a condition of receiving the service," which indicates a precondition and does not satisfy Criterion 2.

After reviewing the three choices, we can summarize that:

- **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** both fail to meet Criterion 2 due to the implication of preconditions in the Consumer obligations.
- **Choice 3** also fails to meet Criterion 2 for the same reason.

However, **Choice 1** is the only choice that explicitly mentions "None" for preconditions, making it slightly clearer in terms of adherence to the criteria compared to the others, which use "N/A". 

Despite all choices having issues, the most precise and clear choice based on the criteria provided is **Choice 1**.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The description of actions does not include precondition(s), as all entries appropriately state "None" for preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2:** Each atomic statement is classified correctly as obligations:
   - Tax Authority must levy tax (obligation).
   - Consumer must pay tax (obligation).

However, it incorrectly states that the Consumer must pay the tax on natural gas, which should be excluded according to the domain's requirement to ignore gas-related regulations.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The description of actions does not include precondition(s), as indicated by "N/A" for preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2:** Each statement is classified correctly as obligations.
   - Tax Authority must levy tax (obligation).
   - Consumer must pay tax (obligation).

Similar to Choice 1, it incorrectly includes the Consumer's obligation to pay tax on natural gas, violating the directive to ignore gas-related regulations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The description of actions does not include precondition(s), as shown by "N/A" for preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2:** Each statement is classified correctly as obligations.
   - Tax Authority must levy tax (obligation).
   - Consumer must pay tax (obligation).

This choice also fails to align with the requirement to exclude gas-related obligations, as it lists the Consumer's obligation to pay tax on natural gas, which is not permissible per the domain context.

### Conclusion:
All three choices incorrectly include obligations related to the supply of natural gas, which should be ignored according to the domain requirements. However, if we were to choose the best among them based on the criteria of handling actions without preconditions and correct classification, **Choice 1** is slightly better formatted as it specifies "None" for preconditions explicitly.

Despite all choices having the same fundamental flaw regarding natural gas regulations, the best choice is **1** because it provides clear indications of preconditions (None) and maintains a consistent format. 

The best choice is 1.

Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** The choice does not include a «Precondition» Intentional Element that serves as the source of a Dependency. The obligations for both actors are presented as direct obligations without any condition.
   
2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency is an Obligation (IE1 - Tax Authority) and the target is also an Obligation (IE2 - Consumer). This is a violation of the criterion, as the target should ideally be an «Obligation» or a «Permission».

3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplications in model elements; each goal is distinct.

Overall, Choice 1 fails primarily due to not having a proper «Precondition» as a source for Dependency.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, there is no «Precondition» Intentional Element as the source of a Dependency. 

2. **Criterion 2:** The model has the source as an «Obligation» (IE2 - Consumer) and the target as another «Obligation» (IE1 - Tax Authority). This is also a violation, as the target should be either an «Obligation» or a «Permission».

3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplicate elements in the model.

Choice 2 also fails primarily due to the lack of a «Precondition» and improper Dependency linking.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1:** This choice also does not have a «Precondition» Intentional Element that serves as the source of a Dependency.

2. **Criterion 2:** The source of the Dependency is an Obligation (IE1 - Tax Authority) and the target is also an Obligation (IE2 - Consumer), which violates this criterion.

3. **Criterion 3:** There are no duplicate elements in the model.

Choice 3, like the previous choices, fails due to the absence of a «Precondition» and incorrect Dependency structure.

### Conclusion:
All choices have significant issues primarily related to the lack of proper «Precondition» Intentional Elements and incorrect Dependency structures. However, they all avoid duplicating model elements. Given that none of the choices fully meets the criteria, we must identify the one that is the least problematic. 

Considering the structure, **Choice 1** and **Choice 3** are quite similar, but **Choice 1** has a more coherent structure in terms of presenting the actors and their goals.

Thus, taking into account the slight advantage in structural clarity, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: The model does not include any «Precondition» IntentionalElement, meaning there's no source of a Dependency that qualifies under this criterion. This is a significant issue.
  
2. **Dependency Validity**: The model does show a Dependency from the Tax Authority's obligation to levy a tax (source) to the Consumer's obligation to pay the tax (target). This aligns with the requirement that the source must be a «Precondition», which is not met here.

3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication of model elements in this choice. Each IntentionalElement has a unique description.

Overall, this choice fails to meet the first two criteria due to the absence of a «Precondition».

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, this model lacks a «Precondition» IntentionalElement, failing to establish a source for any Dependency. Therefore, it does not meet the first criterion.

2. **Dependency Validity**: The model includes a Dependency from the Consumer's obligation (IE2) to the Tax Authority's obligation (IE1). However, since IE1 is not a «Precondition», this does not satisfy the second criterion.

3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication present in this choice as well, with each IntentionalElement uniquely described.

This choice also fails to satisfy criteria 1 and 2 due to the absence of a «Precondition».

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: This choice, like the previous ones, does not include a «Precondition» IntentionalElement, which means it fails to establish a source for any Dependency. Thus, it does not meet the first criterion.

2. **Dependency Validity**: The model shows a Dependency from the Tax Authority's obligation (IE1) to the Consumer's obligation (IE2). However, since the source (IE1) is not a «Precondition», it does not meet the second criterion.

3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication of model elements; each IntentionalElement has a unique description.

This choice also fails to satisfy criteria 1 and 2.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria due to the absence of a «Precondition» IntentionalElement. Therefore, none of these choices are valid in constructing the desired domain model. However, since they all provide a structured approach to representing obligations, if I must choose one, I would select the one that has a better organization of elements, which is Choice 1. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is **IE1**, which is a Goal (levy a tax on the supply of electricity). This satisfies the precondition of being an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is **IE1**, and the target is **IE2** (pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity). Both elements are Obligations, satisfying this criterion.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in model elements since all descriptions are unique.

This choice meets all criteria.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is **IE2**, which is also a Goal. However, this violates the requirement that the source of a Dependency must be a **Precondition**.
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Dependency is **IE1** (levy a tax on the supply of electricity), which is an Obligation, but it is irrelevant due to the failure of Criterion 1.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in model elements.

This choice fails on Criterion 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is **IE1** (levy a tax on the supply of electricity), which is a Goal. However, it does not have a Precondition associated with it, which is a failure for this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: While the source is a Goal, the relationship is incorrectly structured because there is no Precondition defined, failing to meet the necessary structure for Dependencies.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications in model elements.

This choice fails on Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all the choices, only Choice 1 meets all the specified criteria necessary for the domain model. Therefore, "The best choice is 1".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To analyze the provided choices in relation to the criteria specified for the domain model focused on generating Legal GRL models from law articles, we will evaluate each choice based on the three stated criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Precondition Source**: The model does not have any intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition, which means it does not satisfy Criterion 1.
- **Dependency Connections**: The source of the Dependency (IE1) is an Obligation, but there are no Dependencies that fulfill the requirements of Criterion 2, as there are no Precondition elements present.
- **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicated model elements here, which satisfies Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: Fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Precondition Source**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition, failing Criterion 1.
- **Dependency Connections**: The Dependency described does not have a Precondition as its source. It only connects Obligations (IE1 and IE2), thus failing Criterion 2.
- **Duplication Check**: No duplicated model elements are present, satisfying Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: Fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Precondition Source**: Again, there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition. Therefore, Criterion 1 is not met.
- **Dependency Connections**: The Dependency again only connects Obligations (IE1 and IE2), failing to meet the requirements of Criterion 2 as no Precondition is involved.
- **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicated model elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: Fails to meet Criteria 1 and 2.

---

### Overall Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the critical Criteria 1 and 2 regarding the presence of a Precondition and the correct target for Dependencies. No choices are fully compliant with the requirements specified for the domain model. 

However, if we strictly consider the existing models with the least violations of the criteria, all choices are equally poor in meeting the required specifications. 

Considering the structure and coherence, the best choice is **Choice 3** due to its clearer structure and organization, despite all choices failing the critical criteria.

The best choice is 3.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Successfully extracts and identifies the obligations for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer.
  
- **Classify and Format Statements**: Both actors have obligations defined, but there are no preconditions identified, which affects the model's completeness.

- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - The `Tax Authority` has a goal (`IE1`) with modality Obligation.
  - The `Consumer` has a goal (`IE2`) with modality Obligation.
  - However, there are no preconditions associated with the goals, which violates **Criterion 1**. This means there can't be a valid dependency since the source is not a precondition.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar extraction as Choice 1, correctly identifying obligations.

- **Classify and Format Statements**: Again, no preconditions noted, which is a shortcoming.

- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - The `Tax Authority` goal (`IE1`) is connected to the `Consumer` goal (`IE2`) through a dependency, but the dependency source is not a precondition, violating **Criterion 1**.
  - The model does not conform to the criteria regarding preconditions and dependencies.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Matches the previous choices in terms of extraction of obligations.

- **Classify and Format Statements**: No preconditions are defined, similar to the previous choices.

- **Model Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - The model defines the `Tax Authority` goal (`IE1`), which is used as a source for a dependency to the `Consumer` goal (`IE2`).
  - However, like Choices 1 and 2, it fails to satisfy **Criterion 1** because the dependency source is not a precondition.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet **Criterion 1**, as none of them have a proper precondition to serve as the source for a dependency. Therefore, they do not satisfy the necessary criteria for a valid model. However, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are similar in their shortcomings, and none can be deemed better than the others based on the provided criteria.

Given the analysis, **the best choice** is ambiguous since all choices have similar limitations; however, if I must select one based on clarity and systematic representation of elements, I would lean toward the first choice for its clearer structure in presenting the elements.

Thus, "The best choice is 1".

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
The focus of the model is: Ignore the gas related regulation.
Create the model from the perspective of focal actors: Tax Authority and Consumer.

The model is created using the following domain:
The tax is levied on the supply of natural gas or electricity via a connection to the consumer, as well as on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

1. **Refine Obligations:**
   - For Tax Authority's obligation: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
     - Propositional Logic: A (Tax Authority levies tax on electricity)
     
   - For Consumer's obligation: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity"
     - Propositional Logic: B (Consumer pays tax on electricity)

2. **Syntax Tree:**
   - Since both obligations are atomic, there are no further decomposition or sub-elements needed.

3. **Create IntentionalElements:**
   - No non-root nodes exist in the tree, so we will keep the original obligations.

4. **Connect original IntentionalElements:**
   - They are already connected through dependency links in the previous model.

5. **Contribution Links:**
   - Contribution from Tax Authority's obligation to Consumer's obligation can be established:
     - The satisfaction of "levy a tax on the supply of electricity" (IE1) positively impacts "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity" (IE2) with a contribution level of +100.

### Refined Legal GRL Model:
```

        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:

            source: IE1
            target: IE2
            level: 100
;
``` 

This refined model maintains the focus on the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer, establishing necessary dependencies and contributions while ignoring any gas-related regulations.

Choice 3:
### Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
1. The Tax Authority must levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
  
2. The Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity as a condition of receiving the service.

                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
;
``` 

### Refine Legal GRL model: 

1. **Propositional Logic Formulas:**
   - For the Tax Authority's obligation:
     - A: the Tax Authority levies a tax on the supply of electricity.
   - For the Consumer's obligation:
     - B: the Consumer pays the tax levied on the supply of electricity.

   This can be described as:
   - **Obligation_TA**: A
   - **Obligation_C**: B

2. **Syntax Tree:**
   - Since both obligations are singular and do not connect with logical operators, we can represent them directly without further decomposition.

3. **Intentional Elements:**
   - We create sub-elements for each obligation:
     - **Obligation_TA**: the Tax Authority levies a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
     - **Obligation_C**: the Consumer pays the tax levied on the supply of electricity.

4. **Decompositions:**
   - There are no decompositions necessary since each obligation is straightforward.

5. **Contribution Links:**
   - There is a direct dependency as the Consumer's obligation is dependent on the Tax Authority fulfilling its obligation to levy the tax.

The refined Legal GRL model thus looks like this:

``` 
Model:
    actors = Actor:
        name: "Tax Authority"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE1"
                description: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
    elementLinks = EL:
        Dependency:
            source: IE1
            target: IE2
    actors = Actor:
        name: "Consumer"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE2"
                description: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
;
```

This refined model maintains the original obligations while ensuring clarity in dependencies and the relationships between the Tax Authority and the Consumer, accurately reflecting the legal requirements without introducing gas-related regulations.

 Let's analyze the three choices in detail based on the provided criteria and the domain description regarding the Tax Authority and Consumer obligations related to the tax on electricity.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition and Modality**:
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations into their respective intentional elements (IE1 for the Tax Authority and IE2 for the Consumer). However, it attempts to create additional sub-elements (IE1_A and IE2_B) that are not necessary as both obligations are already atomic.
   - The model does not violate the decomposition criterion, as each type of intentional element is kept separate.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Each obligation is treated independently without further decomposition, leading to a clear representation. However, the introduction of sub-elements for obligations complicates the model unnecessarily.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition and Modality**:
   - This model also appropriately keeps the obligations distinct. It maintains clarity by not introducing unnecessary sub-elements and sticks to the atomic nature of the obligations.
   - The contribution link (+100) is introduced, indicating the Tax Authority's obligation directly impacts the Consumer's obligation, which is a valid addition.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Each obligation stands alone, and the contribution link strengthens the relationship between the two obligations without violating the criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition and Modality**:
   - Similar to the previous choices, this model maintains the atomic nature of the obligations. However, like Choice 1, it does not introduce sub-elements that are unnecessary.
   - It effectively represents the obligations of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Each obligation is treated independently, and the model captures the necessary dependencies without excess complexity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, Choice 2 stands out as the most effective model. It adheres to the criteria regarding decomposition, maintains clarity by avoiding unnecessary complexity, and introduces a contribution link that enhances the representation of the relationships between the obligations.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model decomposes the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer into atomic elements; however, it introduces sub-elements (IE1_A and IE2_B) which are not necessary as the obligations are already atomic. This violates Criterion 1 since it combines different levels of intentional elements unnecessarily.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model does not decompose any intentional elements into multiple elements; it only represents the two obligations. This aligns with Criterion 2 but is not well executed due to the mismanagement of atomicity.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: This model also presents the obligations without unnecessary decomposition. Both obligations remain atomic and clearly defined. The obligations are not further broken down, which is compliant with Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The obligations are clearly linked through dependency, but there’s an additional contribution link added. While this is informative, it does not violate any criteria explicitly. It maintains a clear structure without unnecessary complexity. 

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 2, this choice maintains atomic obligations for both actors. The obligations are stated clearly, and no unnecessary sub-elements are introduced, adhering to Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model similarly maintains a direct dependency between the obligations without introducing additional complexity. However, it does not include any contribution links.

### Conclusion:
Both Choices 2 and 3 adhere to the criteria effectively, with Choice 2 providing additional context through contribution links, which enhances understanding of the relationship between the obligations. Choice 1, however, introduces unnecessary complexity which detracts from its effectiveness.

Given that the focus is on clarity and adherence to the defined criteria, and considering the added value of contribution links in Choice 2, I conclude:

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition between Intentional Elements**: 
   - The model decomposes obligations into atomic elements, but it does not decompose between the same type of Intentional Elements. Each obligation remains atomic and does not decompose further.
   - **Criterion 1** is satisfied since there are no improper decompositions.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - Each obligation (IE1 and IE2) is a single atomic element, and there is no decomposition into multiple Intentional Elements. This is a valid approach as it maintains the atomic nature of the obligations.
   - **Criterion 2** is satisfied as both obligations are clearly presented without unnecessary complexity.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition between Intentional Elements**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, it maintains the atomic nature of obligations, and there are no unnecessary decompositions between different types.
   - **Criterion 1** is satisfied.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model retains single atomic obligations without further breakdown. While it establishes a contribution link, it does not decompose into multiple Intentional Elements.
   - **Criterion 2** is also satisfied since it effectively links the two obligations without altering their atomic status.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition between Intentional Elements**: 
   - Like the previous choices, it does not decompose obligations into inappropriate types, maintaining clarity and fidelity to the original statements.
   - **Criterion 1** is satisfied.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - Again, it does not break down the obligations further, retaining their atomic nature and ensuring clarity in dependency.
   - **Criterion 2** is satisfied, as it correctly represents the relationships without unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:
All three choices effectively meet the criteria for decomposition and target, maintaining clarity in their representation of the legal obligations. However, **Choice 2** stands out due to its explicit establishment of contribution links, enhancing the model's expressiveness while still adhering strictly to the criteria. It captures the relationships between the obligations in a more comprehensive manner without introducing unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 2.

 ### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:
1. **Decomposition**: The model maintains distinct obligations for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer without violating Criterion 1. Each obligation is classified correctly and does not lead to improper decompositions.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: However, the model incorrectly attempts to decompose obligations into atomic statements within the same actor, which leads to unnecessary complexity. Although it captures the obligations correctly, the additional elements (IE1_A and IE2_B) complicate the model without adding value. This violates Criterion 2, as there are no more than one intentional element per obligation type.

#### Choice 2:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, this model keeps the obligations distinct and correctly classified. The model does not violate Criterion 1 since it does not attempt to decompose obligations into different types.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The addition of contribution links establishes a direct relationship between the Tax Authority's obligation and the Consumer's obligation. This allows for a clear dependency that reflects the legal requirements accurately. However, the contribution link is somewhat unnecessary given the context, as the main goal is to focus on obligations without introducing further complexity. Nevertheless, it remains compliant with the criteria.

#### Choice 3:
1. **Decomposition**: This choice mirrors the structure of the previous models, maintaining clear distinctions and classifications for the obligations of both actors. As with the other choices, it adheres to Criterion 1.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: The model does not contain unnecessary sub-elements or links, which keeps it clean and easy to understand. However, it lacks the same contribution links present in Choice 2, which could help illustrate the relationship between the obligations more clearly.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that while Choices 1 and 3 maintain clarity and simplicity, they do not leverage the potential benefits of establishing relationships through contribution links. Choice 2, while introducing a slight complexity, provides a more complete representation of the obligations and their interdependencies. Therefore, the best choice is **2**. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria and the domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Decomposition Check (Criterion 1)**: The model separates obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer but doesn't decompose them into further intentional elements. This aligns with the criterion, as no intentional elements are incorrectly decomposed.
- **Target of Decomposition (Criterion 2)**: Both obligations are atomic and do not require further decomposition. However, there are no dependencies between multiple intentional elements leading to a lack of complex relationships. This could be seen as not fully utilizing the potential for interrelations between the obligations.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Decomposition Check (Criterion 1)**: Similar to Choice 1, it maintains the separation of obligations without unnecessary decomposition. This is compliant with the criterion.
- **Target of Decomposition (Criterion 2)**: The model introduces a contribution link between the Tax Authority's obligation and the Consumer's obligation. This is a positive aspect, as it shows a relationship between the two intentional elements. However, it still lacks deeper interdependencies or connections that could enrich the model further.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Decomposition Check (Criterion 1)**: Like the previous choices, it keeps obligations intact without decomposition into incorrect types. This complies with the criterion.
- **Target of Decomposition (Criterion 2)**: It establishes a direct dependency between the Tax Authority's and Consumer's obligations. However, it lacks any additional relationships or contributions that could indicate how the fulfillment of one obligation affects the other, making it somewhat limited in expressing the dynamics of the obligations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it's evident that Choice 2 stands out due to its inclusion of contribution links, which adds a layer of complexity and interrelation between the obligations, making it a more comprehensive representation of the legal model. Choices 1 and 3 are more straightforward and compliant but lack this depth. 

The best choice is 2.

``` 

### Refine Legal GRL model: 
1. **Refine Obligations:**
   - For Tax Authority's obligation: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
     - Propositional Logic: A (Tax Authority levies tax on electricity)
     
   - For Consumer's obligation: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity"
     - Propositional Logic: B (Consumer pays tax on electricity)

2. **Syntax Tree:**
   - Since both obligations are atomic, there are no further decomposition or sub-elements needed.

3. **Create IntentionalElements:**
   - No non-root nodes exist in the tree, so we will keep the original obligations.

4. **Connect original IntentionalElements:**
   - They are already connected through dependency links in the previous model.

5. **Contribution Links:**
   - Contribution from Tax Authority's obligation to Consumer's obligation can be established:
     - The satisfaction of "levy a tax on the supply of electricity" (IE1) positively impacts "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity" (IE2) with a contribution level of +100.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - The choice extracts atomic statements related primarily to the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, it does not emphasize the legal obligation clearly with terms like "shall" or "must."
   - The statement about the Consumer being "subject to tax" is vague, as it does not specify the conditions under which this applies.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no preconditions extracted for clauses that start with "if." Thus, this choice does not meet the requirement for detailing circumstances under which the Consumer must pay taxes.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice uses the term "shall" which indicates a legal obligation, making it clear that the Tax Authority must levy taxes and the Consumer must pay them.
   - The statements are clear and directly link the roles of the Tax Authority and Consumer with the relevant actions and subjects (tax on electricity and natural gas).
   
2. **Preconditions**:
   - Preconditions are well-extracted in statements 4, 5, and 6, which clearly state that the Consumer must pay the tax **if** the supply is through the specified connection. This aligns with the requirement to detail conditional obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, it uses "shall" indicating obligations. However, it uses "taxes" instead of "tax," which may not be as precise, depending on the intent of the law.
   - The statements convey the necessary actions of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer but do not clarify that the tax applies only under specific connections.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Preconditions are present, but they are slightly more ambiguous. The phrase "designated connection established by the Tax Authority" could be interpreted in various ways, potentially leading to confusion about what constitutes a "designated connection."

### Conclusion:
Evaluating all choices against the criteria, **Choice 2** stands out as the best option. It clearly articulates the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer, maintains clarity with the use of "shall," and effectively captures the preconditions for tax liability. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The first two statements correctly reflect the Tax Authority's obligation to levy taxes on the supply of electricity and natural gas, focusing on the connection to the consumer.
   - The third and fourth statements address the Consumer's potential tax liability on electricity and natural gas supply, but they include a connection to the consumer which is a necessary aspect of the regulation.
   - However, the second statement includes a reference to the CNG filling station, which is gas-related and should be ignored as per the focus of the model.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no statements with preconditions starting with "if". Thus, this choice does not satisfy Criterion 2.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Each statement clearly articulates the Tax Authority's obligation and the Consumer's responsibilities concerning taxes on the supply of electricity and natural gas. This includes the correct terminology and legal obligations.
   - The inclusion of "if" clauses in statements 4, 5, and 6 accurately captures the necessary conditions under which the Consumer must pay taxes, reflecting a thorough understanding of legal stipulations.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The statements with "if" clauses successfully illustrate the preconditions for tax liability, fulfilling Criterion 2. 

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, the statements clearly articulate obligations for the Tax Authority and responsibilities for the Consumer. However, the use of "taxes" instead of "tax" can introduce ambiguity.
   - The third statement again includes the CNG filling station, which is inconsistent with the model's aim to ignore gas-related regulations.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The statements with "if" clauses (4 and 5) are present, indicating preconditions are met. However, the general wording is less precise than in Choice 2.

### Conclusion:
Considering the criteria, Choice 2 stands out as it successfully extracts atomic statements from the law article from the perspectives of the Tax Authority and Consumer, and it includes clear preconditions for tax liability. In contrast, both Choices 1 and 3 have shortcomings related to gas-related regulations and clarity. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements are quite clear, but they include the supply of natural gas via a CNG filling station, which should be ignored as per the focus of the model.
   - The statements also do not explicitly state that the Consumer must pay the taxes; they only say they "may be subject," which doesn't convey a strong obligation.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no "if" clauses present in any of the statements, which makes this choice weak in terms of capturing preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - This choice effectively uses "shall," which conveys a clear obligation for the Tax Authority to levy taxes. However, it includes the supply of natural gas via a CNG filling station, which is not aligned with the focus to ignore gas-related regulations.
   - The statements clearly define the Consumer's obligations to pay taxes with "must," which represents a strong requirement.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are preconditions present in statements 4, 5, and 6, which articulate that the Consumer must pay taxes if certain conditions are met. This is a positive aspect of this choice.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, this choice also uses "shall," which indicates obligations. However, it too includes the supply of natural gas via a CNG filling station, which should be ignored.
   - The Consumer's obligations are stated with "shall," which is a strong requirement. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the connection to the consumer for the supply of electricity, as it uses the phrase "designated connection established by the Tax Authority," which could be seen as overly vague.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are preconditions present in statements 4 and 5, which articulate conditions for the Consumer's obligations. However, the phrasing is somewhat ambiguous regarding what constitutes a "designated connection."

### Conclusion:
- Choice 1 lacks preconditions and includes information that should have been ignored. 
- Choice 2, while including unnecessary information about the CNG filling station, provides clear obligations and articulates preconditions effectively.
- Choice 3 also includes the unnecessary gas-related regulation but lacks clarity in its conditional phrasing.

Considering all the criteria and the focus of the model to ignore gas-related regulations while ensuring obligations and preconditions are clearly stated, the best choice is **2**.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - The statements extracted do include atomic legal statements from the perspective of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, but it misses the explicit obligation on the Consumer to pay taxes. It's also important to note that it includes the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station, which may be considered gas-related regulation despite the request to ignore it.
   
2. **Preconditions**: 
   - There are no clauses that start with "if," therefore there are no preconditions identified in this choice.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - This choice provides atomic legal statements that clearly articulate the obligations of the Tax Authority and the Consumer. It differentiates between the obligations of the Tax Authority and the conditions under which the Consumer must pay taxes, which is beneficial for clarity.
   
2. **Preconditions**: 
   - It identifies relevant preconditions with clauses starting with "if," specifically detailing the conditions under which the Consumer must pay taxes on electricity and natural gas supplied through specific connections.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - Similar to Choice 2, this choice presents atomic legal statements that outline the duties of the Tax Authority and the Consumer. However, it also includes the gas supply regulation via a CNG filling station, which should be ignored according to the requirements.
   
2. **Preconditions**: 
   - It incorporates preconditions for the Consumer's obligation to pay taxes, but the phrasing of the conditions is less straightforward than in Choice 2. It mentions a "designated connection established by the Tax Authority," which could introduce ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, Choice 2 stands out as the most complete and clear in terms of meeting the criteria. It effectively extracts atomic legal statements and properly identifies preconditions without including gas-related regulations that should be ignored. 

The best choice is 2.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic statements**:
   - The statements are clear and correctly represent the actions and obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer concerning electricity and natural gas supply.
   - However, it includes a statement about natural gas via a CNG filling station, which was instructed to be ignored.
   
2. **Preconditions**:
   - There are no "if" clauses, meaning that this choice does not address the preconditions for tax obligations effectively.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic statements**:
   - This choice includes clear and actionable statements for both the Tax Authority and the Consumer.
   - It correctly includes the electric supply but also includes statements related to natural gas, which should be ignored as per the instruction.
   
2. **Preconditions**:
   - The inclusion of "if" clauses for various tax obligations indicates that preconditions are well captured, fulfilling this criterion.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, it provides a clear articulation of the obligations of both the Tax Authority and Consumer.
   - However, it also includes references to natural gas, which should have been excluded according to the instructions.
   
2. **Preconditions**:
   - The use of "if" clauses indicates that it captures preconditions effectively, similar to Choice 2.

### Conclusion:
All choices provide atomic statements regarding obligations but fail to fully adhere to the directive to ignore gas-related regulations. However, Choices 2 and 3 stand out for their inclusion of preconditions, which is a critical aspect of the model. Given that both choices include unnecessary references to natural gas, Choice 2 is slightly clearer in its language and structure. Thus, the best choice among the options, despite the oversight regarding gas regulations, is:

   - **Actor:** Consumer
   - **Modal Verb:** must
   - **Modality:** Obligation
   - **Action(s):** pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer
   - **Precondition(s):** if the natural gas is supplied through such a connection (does not meet criterion 1)

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** Although the first two statements meet the criteria, the last two do not because they include preconditions. 

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Tax Authority** shall levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - Meets all criteria.

2. **Tax Authority** shall levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
   - Meets all criteria.

3. **Tax Authority** shall levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station.
   - This statement should be excluded as it pertains to gas regulation, which we are ignoring.

4. **Consumer** must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer if the electricity is supplied through such a connection.
   - Does not meet criterion 1 due to precondition.

5. **Consumer** must pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer if the natural gas is supplied through such a connection.
   - Does not meet criterion 1 due to precondition.

6. **Consumer** must pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to a CNG filling station if the natural gas is supplied through such a connection.
   - This statement should be excluded as it pertains to gas regulation, which we are ignoring.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** The majority of the statements do not meet the criteria due to preconditions. Additionally, the mention of gas-related regulation affects its validity.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Tax Authority** shall levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   - Meets all criteria.

2. **Tax Authority** shall levy a tax on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer.
   - Meets all criteria.

3. **Consumer** must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer if the electricity is supplied through such a connection.
   - Does not meet criterion 1 due to precondition.

4. **Consumer** must pay the tax levied on the supply of natural gas via a connection to the consumer if the natural gas is supplied through such a connection.
   - Does not meet criterion 1 due to precondition.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** Similar to Choice 1, the last two statements fail to meet the criteria due to the presence of preconditions.

### Overall Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is clear that none of them fully meet the criteria because they all contain statements with preconditions related to consumer obligations. However, **Choice 1** and **Choice 3** have the least number of violations related to criteria regarding obligations from the Tax Authority. Because of this, and considering the focus on ignoring gas-related regulations, **Choice 1** is preferable as it offers a clearer structure without introducing unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice according to the given criteria and domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Legal Statements**:
   - The statements accurately describe actions without including preconditions for the Tax Authority.
   - The obligations for the Consumer include preconditions, which violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - All statements are classified correctly as obligations.
   - However, the Consumer's obligations contain preconditions, which is a violation of Criterion 1.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Legal Statements**:
   - The first two statements regarding the Tax Authority are correct and do not include preconditions.
   - The third statement regarding the CNG filling station is irrelevant as per the focus of the model (which is to ignore gas-related regulation), and this introduces unnecessary complexity.
   - The Consumer's obligations again include preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - The classification is consistent, with all statements labeled as obligations.
   - The presence of preconditions in the Consumer’s obligations violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Legal Statements**:
   - The statements correctly describe the actions without including preconditions for the Tax Authority.
   - The obligations for the Consumer, however, again include preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - All statements are classified as obligations, which is accurate.
   - The preconditions in the Consumer's obligations violate Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, it is evident that all options have issues with the inclusion of preconditions in the Consumer's obligations, which is a significant violation of Criterion 1. However, Choice 1 and Choice 3 do not include extraneous statements related to CNG filling stations, making them cleaner in terms of focus. 

Among these, Choice 1 has fewer obligations and is more concise, thus making it slightly preferable. Therefore, considering the focus and clarity in the context of the provided criteria:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions described do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Classification of Statements**: All statements are correctly classified as obligations. The obligations are clear, and each statement indicates what the Tax Authority and Consumer must do. However, the presence of the precondition in statements 3 and 4 ("if the electricity is supplied...") violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions described do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Classification of Statements**: All statements are properly classified as obligations. However, the inclusion of the third statement concerning the supply of natural gas via a CNG filling station violates the requirement to ignore gas-related regulation. Additionally, the preconditions in statements 4, 5, and 6 violate Criterion 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Action Descriptions**: The actions described do not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Classification of Statements**: All statements are properly classified as obligations. However, similar to Choice 1, the precondition in statements 3 and 4 violates Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, Choice 1 and Choice 3 both include preconditions in their statements, which violates Criterion 1. Choice 2 includes an additional statement related to gas regulation that should be ignored. Therefore, the best choice, which adheres to the criteria while focusing on the relevant actors and actions without including gas-related regulations, is Choice 1.

The best choice is 1.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

To generate a new proposal, you apply some changes to the proposal below and then return the modified elements:

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria: 

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of a Dependency is the "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer," which is a Goal. This meets Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is a Goal, as required, and it links to the target "Electricity must be supplied through such a connection," which is a Precondition (though it is not explicitly stated as an IntentionalElement here). This partially meets Criterion 2, but it is ambiguous as the target may not strictly qualify as an IntentionalElement.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicated model elements. Each element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of a Dependency is "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer," which is a Goal. This meets Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source is a Goal, and the target "if the electricity is supplied through such a connection" acts as a Precondition, but is not modeled correctly as an IntentionalElement. Therefore, it fails to fully meet Criterion 2.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicated model elements. Each element has a unique description.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of a Dependency is "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer," which is a Goal. This meets Criterion 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source is a Goal, and the target "if the electricity is supplied through such a connection" is a Precondition, but it is also not modeled as an IntentionalElement. Thus, it fails to fully meet Criterion 2.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicated model elements. Each element has a unique description.

### Conclusion
All three choices have shortcomings regarding the modeling of the Precondition as an IntentionalElement. However, Choice 1 is the most compliant with the criteria despite its ambiguity in modeling the Precondition. Choices 2 and 3 also fail to clearly define the Precondition as an IntentionalElement, but they contain duplications in their representations. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is the Tax Authority's obligation to levy a tax (IE1). This is a Goal and has modality Obligation, fulfilling the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is a Precondition (IE2), but the target is also a Goal (obligation for the Consumer). This does not satisfy the requirement that the target must be either an Obligation or a Permission. Therefore, this choice fails this criterion.
3. **Criterion 3**: The model elements have unique descriptions. There are no duplicates.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is the Tax Authority's obligation (IE1), which is a Goal with modality Obligation. This satisfies the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source (IE3) is a Precondition, and the target (IE2) is an obligation. This satisfies the requirement.
3. **Criterion 3**: The model elements are unique, with no duplicates.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is the Tax Authority's obligation (IE1), which is a Goal with modality Obligation. This satisfies the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source (IE1) is an Obligation, but the model structure seems incorrect as it suggests IE1 is linked directly to IE2 without clearly defining the precondition (IE3). The precondition is included, but its role in the Dependency is not clear, which makes this model ambiguous in meeting this criterion.
3. **Criterion 3**: The model elements appear to have unique descriptions, avoiding duplication.

### Conclusion:
Choice 1 fails on Criterion 2 due to the incorrect nature of the Dependency target. Choice 2 meets all criteria effectively, while Choice 3 has an ambiguous structure regarding the Dependencies and preconditions. Therefore, the best choice is the one that meets all the criteria clearly and correctly.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- The statements extracted are clear, and focus on the Tax Authority's obligation to levy tax and the Consumer's obligation to pay it.

**Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- The classification of obligations and preconditions is appropriate.
- However, there is no explicit precondition linked to the Tax Authority's obligation.

**Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
- The model includes a dependency from the goal of the Tax Authority (levy a tax) to a precondition ("Electricity must be supplied through such a connection"). This does not meet Criterion 2 since the source is not a precondition (it's an obligation) and the target is also not an obligation or permission.
- The model contains duplicated intentional elements with the same description.

### Choice 2:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- Similar to Choice 1, the statements are focused on the obligations of both actors.

**Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- The classification is appropriate; however, the precondition for the Consumer's obligation is described as a separate goal, which is not ideal.

**Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
- The model captures the dependency correctly, with the Consumer's obligation dependent on the precondition. This meets Criterion 2.
- However, there are duplications in the intentional elements, which violates Criterion 3.

### Choice 3:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- The statements are correctly extracted and focused.

**Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
- The classification is appropriate, and the preconditions are clearly defined.

**Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
- The model structure is similar to Choice 2. However, the linkage of the precondition is not properly established.
- The linkage attempts to create multiple intentional elements with the same description, which violates Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is clear that:
- None of the choices fully satisfy all three criteria without issues.
- Choice 2 comes closest by correctly establishing the precondition-dependency relationship, even though it has issues with element duplication.

Therefore, "The best choice is 2".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: A «Precondition» is present as the source of the Dependency. The source is "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer," which is not a precondition itself but rather an obligation. Thus, this criterion is not met.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency must be a «Precondition», which it is not, and the target must be either an «Obligation» or a «Permission». This criterion is not met either.
3. **Criterion 3**: No duplication of model elements occurs as each element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is "if the electricity is supplied through such a connection," which is a precondition. However, the overall structure seems to misclassify the source and targets.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is not properly identified as a «Precondition», thus failing this criterion as well. The target is an obligation, which is correct, but the wrong source invalidates this.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicated elements, as each element has a unique description.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency is identified correctly as "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer," which is an obligation and not a precondition. Therefore, this criterion is not met.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source is not a «Precondition», which also fails this criterion.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicate model elements, as all elements are distinct.

### Conclusion:
None of the choices meet all the criteria effectively. However, Choice 2 is the closest to fulfilling the requirements, as it correctly identifies the actors and obligations while maintaining a focus on the electricity supply. Despite the misclassification, it reflects an attempt to incorporate the necessary precondition for the Consumer's obligation to pay.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: The model correctly identifies the obligations of the Tax Authority and the Consumer regarding the tax on electricity.
- **Model Elements**:
  - **Tax Authority** has an obligation (IE1) to levy a tax. 
  - **Consumer** has an obligation (IE2) to pay the tax.
  - A dependency is established from the "levy a tax" goal to a precondition, which is incorrectly described as a goal ("Electricity must be supplied through such a connection"). 
- **Criterion Evaluation**:
  - **Criterion 1** is met as the Tax Authority's action is a goal.
  - **Criterion 2** is not fully satisfied because the source of the Dependency is a goal and the target is incorrectly described as a goal rather than an obligation or permission.
  - **Criterion 3** is satisfied as there are no duplicate model elements.
  
### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice captures the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer correctly.
- **Model Elements**:
  - Both actors have their obligations correctly identified.
  - The precondition for the Consumer's obligation is treated as a separate goal (IE3) rather than a precondition.
  - The dependency is incorrectly set from the precondition goal (IE3) to the obligation (IE2).
- **Criterion Evaluation**:
  - **Criterion 1** is met since the source of the Dependency is a goal from the Tax Authority.
  - **Criterion 2** is not satisfied as the target of the Dependency does not align with the expected type (it should be an obligation or permission).
  - **Criterion 3** is satisfied as there are no duplicate model elements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: This choice also mirrors the others in terms of the obligations described.
- **Model Elements**:
  - The obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer are present, but the structure is slightly convoluted.
  - It inaccurately classifies the Consumer's precondition as a goal (IE3).
  - The source of the Dependency is correctly defined as the Tax Authority's goal (IE1) but it incorrectly links to IE2 and includes IE3, which should not be a goal.
- **Criterion Evaluation**:
  - **Criterion 1** is satisfied since it starts from a goal (IE1).
  - **Criterion 2** is not satisfied because the precondition does not serve as the target of the Dependency correctly.
  - **Criterion 3** is not satisfied as there are structural issues and potential duplications in goal types.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, the models have various issues with how preconditions and dependencies are structured. However, both Choices 1 and 2 show a clear intent with the obligations but fail to properly categorize the precondition. Choice 1 has a simpler and more cohesive structure without introducing additional complexities that arise in Choices 2 and 3.

Thus, the most aligned model with the criteria, despite its minor flaws, is Choice 1. 

The best choice is 1.

Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the criteria provided, let's analyze each in detail:

### Choice 1 Analysis
- **Decomposition Validity**: 
  - The model decomposes the Consumer's precondition (IE3) into a dependency with the obligation (IE2) which is valid under Criterion 1, as both are intentional elements of the same type (Goal) and modality (Obligation).
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
  - The decomposition only involves one target (IE2). This contradicts Criterion 2, which requires the target of the decomposition to be more than one intentional element.
  
### Choice 2 Analysis
- **Decomposition Validity**:
  - The model starts with the obligations (IE1 and IE2) and decomposes the Consumer's obligation (IE2) into two sub-elements (IE_B and IE_C) which is valid under Criterion 1 since they are all obligations and preconditions.
- **Target of Decomposition**:
  - The decomposition here correctly targets two elements (IE_B and IE_C), thereby fulfilling Criterion 2.
- **Logical Structure**:
  - The model effectively captures the logical relationships between the obligations and preconditions, enhancing clarity and maintaining focus.

### Choice 3 Analysis
- **Decomposition Validity**:
  - This choice does not further decompose the obligations but keeps them atomic. While it maintains the integrity of the statements, it does not take advantage of the potential for clearer structure as seen in Choice 2.
- **Target of Decomposition**:
  - Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition from the precondition (IE3) to the obligation (IE2) does not involve more than one target, failing Criterion 2.
  
### Conclusion
Based on the analyses:
- Choice 1 fails due to a single target in decomposition.
- Choice 2 meets both criteria successfully and provides a clear and structured model.
- Choice 3 also fails to meet the decomposition requirement.

Thus, the best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Analyzing the three choices in detail:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- The model extracts atomic legal statements clearly, identifying the obligations of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer.
- It maintains proper classification of obligations and preconditions, aligning with the specified criteria.
- The decomposition of the Consumer's obligation into a precondition is appropriate, as it correctly links the precondition to the obligation.
- However, the model combines the obligations into a single goal for the Consumer, which may not fully represent the complexity of the obligations.
- Overall, the model adheres to the criteria, but it lacks the depth of representation by not breaking down the obligations into more granular intentional elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- This choice improves upon the first by refining the Consumer's obligation into sub-elements (IE_B and IE_C), which portray the obligation and its precondition distinctly.
- The model utilizes an AND decomposition, which accurately reflects the logical relationship between the obligation to pay the tax and the condition under which it applies.
- By clearly separating the obligations and preconditions, the model offers a more comprehensive view of the responsibilities of the Consumer.
- It adheres strictly to both decomposition criteria, ensuring that the source and target elements are of the same type and modality.
- This model presents a more robust legal GRL representation.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- This choice replicates the basic structure of Choice 1 but fails to enhance the model with sub-intentional elements.
- The obligations and preconditions are still treated as atomic without any decomposition, which does not capture the complexity of the obligations adequately.
- While it maintains clarity and follows the criteria for decomposition, it does not enrich the model with a more detailed representation of relationships.
- As a result, this model is less informative when compared to Choice 2.

### Conclusion:
Considering all aspects, including the clarity, adherence to criteria, and the depth of representation of obligations and preconditions, **Choice 2** emerges as the most comprehensive and well-structured option, effectively capturing the necessary legal concepts while fulfilling the criteria. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The decomposition is performed correctly. The precondition associated with the Consumer's obligation is a separate intentional element that does not decompose into another type of intentional element. The obligations are also correctly classified.
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the decomposition (Consumer's Precondition) links to the Consumer's obligation, which effectively captures the relationship between the precondition and obligation.

### Conclusion for Choice 1:
The model is well-structured, adhering to both criteria. However, it could benefit from further detailing the obligations as sub-elements to reflect logical connections more explicitly.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The obligations and preconditions are appropriately categorized. However, the model introduces sub-elements for the obligations of the Consumer, which may lead to ambiguity regarding the intended decomposition.
2. **Criterion 2**: The decomposition of the Consumer's obligation into sub-elements is valid. This choice explicitly captures the relationship between paying the tax and the condition under which this obligation holds.

### Conclusion for Choice 2:
Although it captures the relationships in detail, the introduction of sub-elements for obligations could lead to unnecessary complexity. The model is valid but might deviate from a simpler representation.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model adheres to the decomposition rules, maintaining the integrity of the intentional elements. Each element is categorized correctly, and the relationships are clear.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model maintains a straightforward structure without unnecessary decomposition. However, it does not elaborate on the relationships between obligations and preconditions as effectively as Choice 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 3:
This choice maintains a clean structure without unnecessary complexity. However, it lacks the depth in reflecting the logical connections that Choice 2 provides.

### Final Decision:
After analyzing all choices, the model in **Choice 2** offers a detailed representation of obligations and preconditions, effectively capturing the logical relationships while adhering to both criteria. The introduction of sub-elements serves to clarify the connections.

The best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria to determine the best model for generating Legal GRL models from law articles regarding the obligations of the Tax Authority and Consumer while ignoring gas-related regulations.

### Criteria Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.**
   - **Choice 1:** The decomposition is appropriate as it does not mix different types or modalities. The precondition (IE3) is correctly linked to the obligation (IE2) as a dependency. This adheres to the criterion.
   - **Choice 2:** This choice introduces sub-intentional elements (IE_B and IE_C) for the Consumer's obligation (IE2), which is also acceptable as they provide a clearer structure without violating the decomposition rules. The original obligation is an AND decomposition, which fits the criterion.
   - **Choice 3:** This choice maintains atomic statements without further decomposition. The precondition is directly linked to the obligation without introducing sub-elements, which is acceptable under the criterion.

2. **Criterion 2: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.**
   - **Choice 1:** The model links one precondition to one obligation, which does not meet the requirement for decomposition since it expects more than one intentional element.
   - **Choice 2:** Successfully introduces a decomposition into two sub-elements, meeting this criterion.
   - **Choice 3:** Similar to Choice 1, it links one precondition to one obligation without further decomposition, failing to meet the requirement.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Choice 2** stands out as the best option. It adheres to both criteria effectively, providing a clear structure that includes appropriate decomposition of the Consumer's obligation into more than one intentional element, while also maintaining the correct types and modalities throughout the model.

The best choice is 2.

 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
- **Structure**: This model effectively captures the obligations of both the Tax Authority and the Consumer, along with a precondition for the Consumer's obligation.
- **Decomposition**: The decomposition is done correctly with the Consumer's precondition linking to the obligation, which is a valid relationship.
- **Intentional Elements**: Each element is clearly defined and categorized according to its type and modality.
- **Meeting Criteria**: It meets Criterion 1 as the precondition and the obligations are decomposed correctly among their respective types. However, it only has one obligation per actor, which does not fulfill Criterion 2 effectively, as it lacks more than one intentional element for decomposition.

**Choice 2:**
- **Structure**: Similar to Choice 1, it captures the obligations and the precondition.
- **Decomposition**: It attempts to introduce sub-obligations, which adds complexity but provides a clearer logical structure.
- **Intentional Elements**: The model includes sub-elements for the Consumer's obligation, which is a step towards fulfilling Criterion 2 as it creates multiple intentional elements.
- **Meeting Criteria**: It adheres to Criterion 1, as it maintains the type constraints on decomposition. It also fulfills Criterion 2 by having multiple intentional elements (IE_B and IE_C).

**Choice 3:**
- **Structure**: This choice is similar to Choices 1 and 2 but remains at a more atomic level without additional decomposition.
- **Decomposition**: The obligations and preconditions are not further decomposed, which keeps it simple but may lack clarity in complex scenarios.
- **Intentional Elements**: The model holds a clear structure but does not expand on the Consumer's obligation as seen in Choice 2.
- **Meeting Criteria**: It meets Criterion 1 effectively, but like Choice 1, it does not fulfill Criterion 2 as it does not have multiple intentional elements for the Consumer's obligation.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices, Choice 2 stands out as the most comprehensive and structured model. It effectively captures the obligations and preconditions while also introducing sub-elements that provide clarity and meet both criteria satisfactorily.

The best choice is 2.

### Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
1. **Tax Authority** **shall** **levy a tax** **on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer**.

2. **Consumer** **must** **pay the tax** **levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer** **if** **the electricity is supplied through such a connection**.

### Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements: 
1. **Actor**: Tax Authority  
   **Modal Verb**: shall  
   **Modality**: Obligation  
   **Action(s)**: levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer  
   **Precondition(s)**: None

2. **Actor**: Consumer  
   **Modal Verb**: must  
   **Modality**: Obligation  
   **Action(s)**: pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer  
   **Precondition(s)**: if the electricity is supplied through such a connection

### Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "Tax Authority"
        intentionalElements = IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE1"
            description: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
            type: Goal
            modality: Obligation
        IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE2"
            description: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
            type: Goal
            modality: Obligation
    , Actor: 
        name: "Consumer"
        intentionalElements = IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE3"
            description: "if the electricity is supplied through such a connection"
            type: Goal
            modality: Precondition
;

    elementLinks = Dependency: 
        source: IE3
        target: IE2
;
``` 

### Refine Legal GRL model:
1. **Refinement of Obligations**:
   - **Obligation of Tax Authority (IE1)**: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer".
     - Propositional Logic: A
       - A: Tax Authority shall levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer.
   
2. **Refinement of Consumer's Obligation (IE2)**:
   - **Obligation of Consumer (IE2)**: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer if the electricity is supplied through such a connection".
     - Propositional Logic: B and C
       - B: Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity.
       - C: If the electricity is supplied through such a connection.
     - Combined Propositional Logic: B and C.

3. **Constructing the Syntax Tree**:
   - The syntax tree for the Consumer’s obligation is:
```
       AND
       /   \
      B     C
```
4. **Creating Sub Intentional Elements**:
   - **Sub Obligations**:
     - IE_B: "Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity."
     - IE_C: "the electricity is supplied through such a connection."

5. **Connecting Elements**:
   - The original obligation (IE2) will be decomposed into the sub-elements (IE_B and IE_C) using an AND decomposition.

### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:
```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "Tax Authority"
        intentionalElements = IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE1"
            description: "levy a tax on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
            type: Goal
            modality: Obligation
    , Actor: 
        name: "Consumer"
        intentionalElements = IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE2"
            description: "pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity via a connection to the consumer"
            type: Goal
            modality: Obligation
        IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE_B"
            description: "Consumer must pay the tax levied on the supply of electricity."
            type: Goal
            modality: Obligation
        IntentionalElement: 
            id: "IE_C"
            description: "the electricity is supplied through such a connection."
            type: Goal
            modality: Precondition
;

    elementLinks = Dependency: 
        source: IE_C
        target: IE2
    Decomposition: 
        source: IE2
        target: IE_B, IE_C
        decompositionType: AND
    Contribution: 
        source: IE1
        target: IE2
        level: 100
;
``` 

This refined model now captures the obligations and preconditions in more detail, reflecting the logical relationships derived from the legal statements while maintaining focus on the supply of electricity.
