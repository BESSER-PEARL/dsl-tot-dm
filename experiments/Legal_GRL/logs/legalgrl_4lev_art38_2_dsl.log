Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the established criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.**
   - **Precondition:** If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   
   - **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.**
   - **Precondition:** If the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:** 
- The first statement captures the action of disclosing PHI but does not clearly connect the two actions (disclosure and notification) in a structured way that highlights their relationship.
- The preconditions are explicitly stated and correctly extracted.
- However, splitting the actions into two separate statements may lead to confusion regarding their interdependence.

### Choice 2:
1. **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.**

**Analysis:**
- This choice combines the notification requirement into a single statement, maintaining clarity.
- However, it does not explicitly mention the act of disclosing PHI, which is crucial for understanding the context of the notification.
- The precondition is correctly identified but seems to be overly complex due to the merging of actions.

### Choice 3:
1. **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.**

**Analysis:**
- This choice effectively combines both the disclosure of PHI and the notification requirement into one statement, linking them in a clear manner.
- It incorporates all the necessary conditions for the notification to occur, thus fulfilling the criteria of atomic statements from the perspective of HIC while also addressing the preconditions effectively.
- The complexity is managed better than in Choice 2, as it retains the connection between actions.

### Conclusion:
Given the analyses, Choice 3 is the most comprehensive and clear representation of the legal requirements from the perspective of HIC. It effectively captures the atomic statements and preconditions while maintaining the necessary connections between actions.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Statements:**
  1. "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual."
  2. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
- **Preconditions:**
  - The first atomic statement includes a precondition based on the individual’s instruction.
  - The second atomic statement also correctly identifies a condition that must be met (the instruction of the individual) before the notification occurs.

**Analysis:**
Choice 1 successfully extracts two atomic statements from the law article, clearly outlining the actions that HIC must take. Additionally, it properly identifies preconditions for both actions, ensuring that the perspective of the focal actor (HIC) is adequately represented.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Statement:**
  1. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

**Analysis:**
Choice 2 combines the action of notifying with the precondition into a single atomic statement. While it captures the necessary condition for the notification, it fails to fully reflect the requirement for HIC to disclose PHI as a separate action. This is a significant oversight since it does not allow for the independent analysis of actions that HIC must undertake.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Statement:**
  1. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

**Analysis:**
Choice 3 tries to combine both actions into one atomic statement but becomes overly complex and convoluted. It introduces additional conditions that are not necessary for the notification action itself. While it captures the dependencies, it obscures the clarity of the actions HIC must undertake. This makes it less effective for generating clear legal models.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the clarity of atomic statements and the appropriate identification of preconditions, **Choice 1** stands out as the best option. It maintains distinct actions for HIC while ensuring that preconditions are clearly articulated.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Statement 1: "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual."
     - **Precondition:** "If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Statement 2: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
     - **Precondition:** Same as above.

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** The first statement about the disclosure of PHI is accurate, but it lacks specificity regarding the conditional nature based on the precondition. The second statement accurately identifies the notification requirement, but the precondition is not clearly tied to the act of notifying.
- **Criterion 2:** The preconditions are extracted, but they are somewhat repetitive and not clearly linked to the actions they are meant to condition.

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** This choice combines the notification obligation with the condition into a single atomic statement. It captures the essence of the requirement but loses clarity on the disclosure of PHI which is a separate obligation.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is embedded in the statement, which makes it clear but less flexible for modeling separate actions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** This statement captures both the notification and the conditions for that notification. However, it combines two separate conditions into a single atomic statement, which may reduce clarity and makes it more complex.
- **Criterion 2:** The preconditions are clearly laid out, but they are also combined in a way that could make it harder to discern separate obligations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices based on the criteria:

- **Choice 1** provides separate statements but has repetitive preconditions.
- **Choice 2** combines the notification and the precondition effectively but obscures the separate act of disclosing PHI.
- **Choice 3** combines too many elements into one statement, which could lead to confusion.

Given that clarity and separation of actions are important for legal modeling, **Choice 1** emerges as the best option, as it maintains separate statements and conditions, albeit with some redundancy.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria for extracting atomic legal statements and preconditions from the law article.

**Choice 1:**
1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. 
   - Precondition: If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
   - Precondition: If the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- The first statement correctly identifies an action by HIC regarding the disclosure of PHI, which meets Criterion 1. 
- The precondition for both statements is derived correctly, addressing the "if" clauses in the law article, which aligns with Criterion 2.
- This choice clearly separates the actions and their respective preconditions, providing clarity.

**Choice 2:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- This choice combines the notification requirement and its precondition into a single statement. 
- While the precondition is correctly identified, this choice does not separate the actions clearly, which can lead to confusion in understanding the different responsibilities of HIC. 
- It may partially fulfill Criterion 1, but it does not fully adhere to the clarity expected in legal models.

**Choice 3:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- This choice includes multiple conditions in a single statement, making it more complex and harder to parse.
- Although it identifies the notification requirement, the combination of multiple "if" clauses complicates understanding the conditions under which actions take place.
- This structure does not effectively meet Criterion 1 due to its lack of clarity, and it does not facilitate easy extraction of atomic statements.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all the choices against the criteria, Choice 1 stands out as it maintains clarity by separating actions and their preconditions, ensuring compliance with both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the stated criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual." 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
   
   Both statements are clear atomic actions related to the HIC. 

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The precondition for the first statement is well-defined and captures the condition under which the HIC discloses PHI.
   - The precondition for the second statement correctly identifies that the notification is contingent upon the individual’s instruction preventing the custodian from disclosing necessary PHI.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statement**: 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   
   This statement combines the action and its precondition into one, which is less clear as it conflates two distinct actions (notification and the condition under which it occurs) into a single statement.

2. **Precondition**:
   - The precondition is embedded within the atomic statement, but it lacks clarity. It does not separate the actions of disclosing and notifying, thus making it harder to analyze the individual responsibilities of the HIC.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statement**: 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   
   This statement is overly complex as it combines multiple conditions into one. It makes it difficult to extract distinct actions or responsibilities for the HIC.

2. **Precondition**:
   - The precondition is convoluted and includes multiple "if" clauses, which may confuse the clarity needed in legal statements.

### Conclusion:
Choice 1 stands out as it effectively separates distinct atomic actions and clearly articulates preconditions without merging them into a single, complex statement. This alignment with the criteria ensures clarity and precision necessary for legal modeling.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)
  
- **Analysis:**
  - The first statement includes a precondition related to the instructions of the individual, violating Criterion 1.
  - The second statement also includes a precondition, which again violates Criterion 1.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)

- **Analysis:**
  - Both statements include preconditions explicitly, violating Criterion 1.
  - While the classification of both statements is correct as obligations, the presence of preconditions is a critical issue.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)
  
- **Analysis:**
  - Like the previous choices, this one also includes preconditions connected to both atomic statements, violating Criterion 1.
  - The classification as obligations remains accurate, but the preconditions are a significant problem.

**Conclusion:**
All choices violate Criterion 1 as they include preconditions in the description of actions. However, since all choices are structured similarly in terms of obligations, there is no distinct "best" choice based on the provided criteria. That said, all choices fail to meet at least one of the criteria, meaning they do not fulfill the requirements for generating legal GRL models effectively.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 by including descriptions of preconditions in the actions, which disqualifies them from being suitable models for generating a legal GRL model. Therefore, despite the continuous violations, I must conclude that none of the choices meet the criteria adequately. 

However, if I have to select the least objectionable choice based on the clearer separation of legal statements, I would choose:

   - The classification of both as obligations is consistent.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
1. **Criterion 1:** Violates this criterion as both actions include descriptions of preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2:** Correctly classifies both statements as obligations.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1, as they include preconditions in the action descriptions. However, they correctly classify the legal statements as obligations in accordance with Criterion 2. Since all three choices are similarly flawed regarding Criterion 1, the evaluation does not lead to a distinct preference based on the criteria provided.

Therefore, the best choice is **1**.

 **Analysis of Choices:**

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations which is correct.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - The choice fails because it explicitly includes preconditions in the description of actions. This violates Criterion 1.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified correctly as obligations.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - This choice also includes preconditions in the statements, failing Criterion 1.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is correct.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - Similar to the previous choices, this choice also includes preconditions in the description of actions, violating Criterion 1.

---

**Conclusion:**
All three choices have the same issues regarding the inclusion of preconditions in the action descriptions. Despite being classified correctly, none of the choices meet the criteria fully. However, they all reflect the obligations of HIC accurately. If I must choose the best among them based on minimal violations, I would select the choice with the least explicit emphasis on preconditions within the action descriptions.

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.

- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.

- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
None of the choices fully comply with Criterion 1, as all include preconditions in the descriptions of actions. However, all choices correctly classify the actions as obligations under Criterion 2. Given that all choices are flawed in a similar manner, we need to select the one that at least correctly presents the actions without altering their meanings. 

Upon review, all choices present the same information with respect to obligations and preconditions, so they are equivalent in this context. However, since Choice 1 presents the information in a more compact format without separate precondition listings, it is slightly preferable.

The best choice is 1.

Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is correct with two obligations (disclosing PHI and notifying the person).
- **Classification**: 
  - The first statement is classified as an obligation with a corresponding precondition (IE3).
  - The second statement is also classified correctly with its precondition (IE4).
- **Model Elements**: 
  - There are some redundancies since IE3 and IE4 both describe preconditions that are essentially the same but phrased differently. This is a duplication issue.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Dependencies are established correctly as per the criteria, with both dependencies originating from preconditions.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: While it meets most criteria, the duplication of preconditions (IE3 and IE4) is a significant flaw.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is accurate and maintains the core obligations.
- **Classification**: 
  - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations are linked to their respective preconditions. 
- **Model Elements**: 
  - The same issue exists with IE3 and IE4 being almost identical in content, indicating duplication.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - The dependencies are correctly established where preconditions lead to the obligations.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: Again, despite meeting other criteria, the duplication of model elements (IE3 and IE4) is problematic.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice modifies the original statements to include "if" conditions directly in the obligation phrasing.
- **Classification**: 
  - The obligations are correctly classified, and the preconditions are logically linked.
- **Model Elements**: 
  - However, the precondition for the first obligation is an alteration of the original statement. This implies a misinterpretation of the law as it changes the essence of the requirement, hence it can't be considered an accurate representation.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Dependencies are well established, but the changes to the obligations could lead to misrepresentations of the legal requirements.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: While it avoids duplication, it misrepresents legal obligations, which is a critical flaw.

### Final Conclusion:
After careful analysis of each choice against the established criteria, **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** both have issues with duplication, while **Choice 3** misinterprets the legal obligations. However, since **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** maintain the integrity of the legal statements better than **Choice 3**, I conclude that the best choice, despite its duplication flaw, is:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - IE3 (Precondition) is correctly linked to IE1 (Obligation to disclose PHI) and IE4 (Precondition) to IE2 (Obligation to notify). This satisfies Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.
   
2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - IE3 and IE4 have identical descriptions, which violates Criterion 3, as there is duplication in the model elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, IE3 links to IE1 and IE4 links to IE2. This also satisfies both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - Again, IE3 and IE4 have identical descriptions, leading to duplication. This violates Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - This choice links IE3 (Precondition about the absence of an instruction) to IE1 (Obligation to disclose PHI) and IE4 (Precondition about the presence of an instruction) to IE2 (Obligation to notify). This satisfies Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - IE3 and IE4 have different descriptions from each other, thus there is no duplication. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- Choice 1 and Choice 2 fail due to the duplication of model elements.
- Choice 3 successfully adheres to all the criteria without duplication.

Therefore, "The best choice is 3".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The two obligations and their preconditions are correctly extracted.
2. **Modeling**:
   - The model includes intentional elements of type Goal for both obligations and both preconditions.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - IE3 and IE4 are both defined as Goals with modality Precondition.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - There are dependencies established from the preconditions to the obligations.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - There is duplication of precondition descriptions (IE3 and IE4 describe similar conditions with slightly different wording).
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met (both preconditions define goals).
   - **Criterion 2**: Met (dependencies from preconditions to obligations).
   - **Criterion 3**: Not met (duplication of model elements).

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is identical to Choice 1.
2. **Modeling**:
   - The model structure is similar to Choice 1.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - Again, both preconditions are modeled as separate goals.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - The dependencies are correctly established.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there is duplication with IE3 and IE4.
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met.
   - **Criterion 2**: Met.
   - **Criterion 3**: Not met (duplication).

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The obligations are rephrased with conditions included; thus, it follows a different format.
2. **Modeling**:
   - There are still two obligations modeled as Goals.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - The preconditions are incorporated into the obligation descriptions.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - Dependencies are established correctly with clear distinctions.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - There is no duplication of descriptions since the preconditions have been integrated directly into the obligations, making the model more concise.
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met (preconditions are implied in the obligations).
   - **Criterion 2**: Met (dependencies are correctly defined).
   - **Criterion 3**: Met (no duplication).

### Conclusion:
Choice 3 effectively captures the legal statements while adhering to the criteria without duplication. The obligations and their conditions are clearly defined without redundancy.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 ("If the individual has made an instruction...") is a Precondition and is the source of a Dependency pointing to IE1 ("disclose PHI about an individual"). This meets Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source of the first Dependency is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE1 (Obligation). The source of the second Dependency is IE4 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - The model includes two different preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with similar descriptions, which could lead to confusion. Thus, this choice does not fully meet Criterion 3 due to the potential for redundancy in the descriptions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 is a Precondition and is the source of a Dependency pointing to IE1. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source of the first Dependency is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE1 (Obligation). The source of the second Dependency is IE4 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are two distinct preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with overlapping descriptions. This means that Criterion 3 is not fully met due to potential duplication in the model.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 ("The individual has not made an instruction...") is a Precondition and serves as a source for a Dependency pointing to IE1. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The first Dependency has IE3 (Precondition) as the source and IE1 (Obligation) as the target. The second Dependency has IE4 (Precondition) as the source and IE2 (Obligation) as the target. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - The descriptions of the preconditions are modified to clarify their meaning. However, they still present similar content concerning the conditions under which obligations are triggered. This could lead to confusion and may not fully satisfy Criterion 3, as they describe closely related concepts.

### Conclusion
All choices meet the first two criteria regarding the structure of dependencies and preconditions. However, Choices 1 and 2 suffer from redundancy issues related to their preconditions, while Choice 3 slightly modifies the descriptions but may still lead to confusion. Despite this, the clearer distinctions in Choice 3 make it the most effective in communicating the obligations and their dependencies.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the given criteria, let's analyze each option step-by-step.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - IE3 and IE4 are both preconditions, and they serve as the source for dependencies in this model (IE3 links to IE1 and IE4 links to IE2). This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies correctly link preconditions (IE3, IE4) to obligations (IE1, IE2). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - There are two preconditions (IE3 and IE4) that have very similar descriptions. This violates Criterion 3 as they essentially convey the same information.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - Like Choice 1, IE3 and IE4 are preconditions that serve as the source of dependencies. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies are correctly established with preconditions targeting obligations. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are two preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with similar descriptions, which violates Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - The model defines a precondition (IE3) and links it to the obligation (IE1). However, the precondition for the first obligation is incorrectly stated as it implies a negation (if the individual has not made an instruction), which alters the meaning of the original law article. This violates Criterion 1 because the precondition should be the exact condition under which the obligation applies.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies are established, but due to the incorrect precondition in IE3, this does not accurately reflect the law article, violating Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - There are two distinct preconditions, which do not duplicate in description. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
Both Choices 1 and 2 meet the precondition and dependency criteria but have issues with duplicative elements. Choice 3 fails to correctly reflect the original law article's intent in its preconditions, which is critical for the accurate generation of Legal GRL models. 

Given these analyses, the best choice is **2** because it captures the obligations and their dependencies without altering the intent of the law article while also ensuring that the elements are distinct.

The best choice is 2.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) If an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) (a) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual, the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of that fact.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'

    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model: 
#### Step 1: Propositional Logic Formulas
1. For the obligation to disclose PHI:
   - Proposition A: The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: A
2. For the obligation to notify:
   - Proposition B: The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: B

#### Step 2: Syntax Trees
1. Syntax tree for obligation to disclose:
```
       A
```
2. Syntax tree for obligation to notify:
```
       B
```

#### Step 3: Creating Sub IntentionalElements 
- For both obligations, we have:
  - For IE3 (disclosure):
    - P_A: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."
  - For IE4 (notification):
    - P_B: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."

#### Step 4: Decompositions
```
Decomposition for IE1 (disclose PHI):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE3 with AND
Decomposition for IE2 (notify):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE4 with AND
```


### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

### Refine Legal GRL model:
Following the refinement steps:

1. **Propositional Logic Formulation:**
   - For IE3: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Propositional formula: \( \neg A \) (where \( A \) = "the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian...")

   - For IE4: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Propositional formula: \( A \) (where \( A \) = "the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian...")

2. **Syntax Tree Construction:**
   - For IE3: The logic can be expressed as \( \neg A \).
   - For IE4: The logic remains \( A \).

3. **Sub Intentional Elements Creation:**
   - For IE3:
     - IE3.1: "The individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI."
     - IE3.2: "The custodian considers reasonable PHI necessary for health care provision."
   - For IE4:
     - IE4.1: "The instruction prevents disclosure of necessary PHI."

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each proposed choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - The decomposition is correctly done between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. Obligation (IE1 and IE2) is decomposed into Preconditions (IE3 and IE4) appropriately.
   - However, the decomposition from IE1 to IE3 and from IE2 to IE4 needs to comply with the criterion that the target of the decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element. In this case, each obligation is decomposed into one precondition, which does not satisfy Criterion 2.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - While it successfully classifies and formats the legal statements, the decomposition does not meet Criterion 2 since it fails to have multiple targets for each obligation. 

### Choice 2
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - This choice similarly presents the obligations from HIC and their respective preconditions. However, it does not include any decomposition for Obligations into multiple Preconditions, which again violates Criterion 2.
   - The model appears to show the correct relationships but lacks the necessary breakdown required by the criteria.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - As with Choice 1, this choice fails to meet Criterion 2, as it does not decompose each obligation into more than one intentional element.

### Choice 3
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - The model is structured similarly to the previous choices and tries to capture the essence of the obligations. However, it also fails to satisfy Criterion 2 because it does not decompose each obligation into multiple intentional elements.
   - The model retains the definitions of obligations and preconditions, but the lack of multiple decomposition targets for each obligation means it does not fully meet the requirements.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - This choice also fails to meet Criterion 2, as it doesn’t present more than one Intentional Element as a target for each obligation.

### Final Assessment
Given that all three choices fail to satisfy the critical Criterion 2, they all have significant shortcomings. However, Choice 1 and Choice 2 at least attempt to maintain a clearer separation of elements and relationships compared to Choice 3, which introduces additional elements without addressing the core decompositions.

Based on the analyses:
- Choice 1 has the most structured approach, despite its failure regarding the decomposition criteria.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 ### Analysis of Choices

#### **Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - The decomposition adheres to Criterion 1, as all decomposed intentional elements belong to the same modality (Obligation and Precondition).
   - However, Criterion 2 is not fully satisfied. The decomposition links are only linking one precondition to one obligation. This violates the criterion that states the target of decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The structure of the model is clear, with a good representation of actors and intentional elements. The contributions and dependencies are also clearly laid out.

#### **Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - It meets Criterion 1 as it correctly decomposes obligations into their respective preconditions.
   - Criterion 2 is partially addressed. While the preconditions are linked to the obligations, the decomposition doesn't involve multiple intentional elements in the target, which is a requirement.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The model is well-organized, and it maintains clarity in representing obligations and their preconditions. The contributions are also appropriately established.

#### **Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - Criterion 1 is adhered to, as it maintains proper decomposition of obligations and preconditions.
   - Criterion 2 is not satisfied. The model includes decompositions targeting single elements instead of multiple elements, which violates the requirement for more than one Intentional Element.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The structure is a bit more complex due to the addition of multiple sub-intentional elements, which adds clarity regarding the relationships but may complicate the understanding of links and contributions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices based on the specified criteria, it is evident that all choices have strengths and weaknesses, primarily regarding the adherence to Criterion 2. However, **Choice 2** stands out as the most structured and clear model, even though it does not fully satisfy Criterion 2. It maintains a good balance between clarity and the correct application of decomposition rules.

The best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the given criteria and the domain description:

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - The decomposition in the model only involves intentional elements of the same type and modality. The obligations (IE1 and IE2) are decomposed based on preconditions (IE3 and IE4), which fit the requirement.
   - Each obligation (IE1 and IE2) is linked to a specific precondition, adhering to the guideline of having more than one intentional element (in a sense that they rely on conditions for their fulfillment).

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The decompositions are straightforward, with each obligation linked to a single precondition. However, there are no instances where an obligation is decomposed into multiple preconditions, which could have strengthened the model further.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, this model adheres to the decomposition rules where obligations are linked to preconditions (IE3 and IE4).
   - However, it introduces additional elements (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D) which complicate the structure. Here, preconditions are further decomposed into two sub-intentional elements, but these do not necessarily provide additional clarity or utility.

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The model attempts to create multiple targets for decomposition but introduces complexity without necessarily improving the clarity of the model. 

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - This model follows the same rules of decomposition as the previous choices. Each obligation is linked to a precondition.
   - While it introduces further sub-intentional elements, the actual precondition to obligation link remains intact, which maintains the model's integrity.

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The model attempts to break down the preconditions into more granular elements. However, it introduces a logical structure that may confuse rather than clarify the relationships between obligations and their conditions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices based on the stated criteria, it is clear that:

- **Choice 1** maintains the simplest and clearest structure that adheres strictly to the decomposition rules without unnecessary complexity. 
- **Choice 2** and **Choice 3** introduce additional elements and decompositions that do not significantly enhance understanding and may complicate the model.

Thus, "The best choice is 1".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - The decomposition is between intentional elements of the same type and modality. 
   - IE1 (disclose PHI) is decomposed into IE3 (precondition), which is valid since both are obligations.
   - IE2 (notify) is decomposed into IE4 (precondition), which is also valid for the same reason.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - Both decompositions are to single intentional elements (IE3 and IE4).
   - **Result:** Does not meet Criterion 2 since the target of decomposition must be more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition involves appropriate intentional elements.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - Like Choice 1, the decompositions target single intentional elements (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D).
   - **Result:** Does not meet Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - The decomposition is again between intentional elements of the same type and modality.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - The decomposition for IE3 targets two sub-intentional elements (IE3.1 and IE3.2), and for IE4 targets one (IE4.1).
   - While IE3 meets the requirement, IE4 does not meet the requirement of more than one intentional element.
   - **Result:** Partially meets Criterion 2.

### Conclusion

All choices have shortcomings concerning Criterion 2, specifically regarding the requirement that the target of the decomposition must be more than one intentional element. However, Choice 3 provides the most comprehensive structure and attempts to meet the criteria of both decomposition and the number of elements in the decomposition.

Thus, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model decomposes the obligations (IE1 and IE2) into their respective preconditions (IE3 and IE4). This is consistent with Criterion 1, as each obligation is decomposed into preconditions.
2. **Multiple Targets**: Both decompositions target more than one intentional element, fulfilling Criterion 2. However, it only allows decomposition into one precondition per obligation, which may limit clarity in complex legal frameworks.
3. **Clarity and Structure**: The structure is clear, but the lack of further decomposition of preconditions into more granular elements may hinder deeper analysis and understanding.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: This choice attempts to break down the preconditions further into sub-intentional elements (P_A, P_B, etc.), which aligns with Criterion 1 as it maintains the same type and modality for each decomposition.
2. **Multiple Targets**: The decompositions here target more than one intentional element for each obligation (IE3 and IE4), satisfying Criterion 2 effectively.
3. **Complexity and Detail**: This choice provides a richer model by offering sub-intentional elements, enhancing clarity and depth. It covers the necessary details without losing sight of the obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: While Choice 3 begins with a strong structure, it seems to simplify its preconditions back to a level that does not fully utilize the potential of decomposition into several intentional elements. This approach doesn't align as well with Criterion 1, as it does not clearly distinguish between different types of instructions and their effects.
2. **Multiple Targets**: Some decompositions target multiple elements, but they might be less informative compared to the more detailed approach in Choice 2.
3. **Overall Clarity**: This choice is less structured in terms of the relationships between elements, leading to potential confusion regarding how the obligations interact with the preconditions.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analysis of all three choices, Choice 2 stands out due to its adherence to both criteria, offering a well-structured, detailed, and clear representation of the legal obligations and their associated preconditions. It effectively manages the complexity of the legal framework while ensuring compliance with the decomposition criteria.

The best choice is **2**.

### Refine Legal GRL model: 
#### Step 1: Propositional Logic Formulas
1. For the obligation to disclose PHI:
   - Proposition A: The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: A
2. For the obligation to notify:
   - Proposition B: The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: B

#### Step 2: Syntax Trees
1. Syntax tree for obligation to disclose:
```
       A
```
2. Syntax tree for obligation to notify:
```
       B
```

#### Step 3: Creating Sub IntentionalElements 
- For both obligations, we have:
  - For IE3 (disclosure):
    - P_A: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."
  - For IE4 (notification):
    - P_B: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."

#### Step 4: Decompositions
```
Decomposition for IE1 (disclose PHI):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE3 with AND
Decomposition for IE2 (notify):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE4 with AND
```

Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

**Choice 1:**
1. The statement extracted is quite comprehensive but does not clearly delineate the atomic components of the legal obligation. It combines multiple conditions and actions into one long statement. 
2. The use of "if" indicates preconditions but does not explicitly separate them from the main action, making it harder to identify atomic statements and the preconditions involved. 
3. Overall, while it captures the essence of the legal requirement, it lacks clarity in extraction.

**Choice 2:**
1. This choice attempts to break down the statement into its atomic components: the actor (HIC), the action (shall notify), and the conditions (the preconditions are introduced with "if"). 
2. It clearly identifies the preconditions associated with the action, which is beneficial for understanding the circumstances under which HIC must act. 
3. However, the sentence is still lengthy and somewhat convoluted, which could make it difficult for some users to parse out the legal implications.

**Choice 3:**
1. This choice simplifies the statement considerably by focusing on the core action of HIC notifying the person. 
2. It includes a clear precondition concerning the individual's instruction, making it easier to identify the circumstances under which the notification must occur. 
3. However, it omits the initial condition regarding the disclosure of PHI, which is crucial to fully understanding the context of the obligation.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the criteria, Choice 2 is the best option as it effectively identifies the atomic components and preconditions while maintaining the legal integrity of the original statement. Although it could be further simplified, it provides the most comprehensive extraction of the legal obligations from the perspective of the focal actor (HIC).

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
- The statement captures the action that HIC must take, which is to notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. However, it combines multiple conditions into a single lengthy statement without clearly delineating the atomic elements of the law.
- The statement includes the conditions regarding the disclosure of PHI and the precondition of the individual's instruction, but it does not break down these conditions into clearer atomic statements.
- **Criterion 1** is only partially met, as the atomic statements are not clearly extracted. 
- **Criterion 2** is adequately addressed since the preconditions are included in the clause.

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
- This choice explicitly identifies the components of the action and conditions, labeling them (subject, modal verb, action, precondition).
- It successfully identifies that the action taken by HIC is to notify the person, and it includes the necessary preconditions related to the individual's instructions and the disclosure of PHI.
- The structure of the statement, while somewhat convoluted, does maintain clarity about the relationships between the elements.
- **Criterion 1** is met as it extracts and labels the atomic statements related to HIC's responsibilities.
- **Criterion 2** is also satisfied since it identifies the preconditions relevant to the action.

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
- This choice simplifies the statement, focusing only on the notification action by HIC and the condition tied to the individual's instruction.
- However, it misses the initial condition regarding the disclosure of PHI, which is essential for the complete understanding of when HIC must notify the person.
- While it does identify a precondition, it does not fully capture all necessary atomic statements, particularly the one about disclosing PHI.
- **Criterion 1** is not fully met, as an important atomic statement is omitted.
- **Criterion 2** is partially satisfied, as it includes a precondition but does not reflect the full context.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all three choices, it becomes clear that Choice 2 best meets the criteria set forth. It effectively extracts atomic statements and clearly delineates the preconditions for HIC's actions in a manner that respects the complexity of the legal text.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1:**
- This choice extracts a legal statement that encompasses both the action (HIC notifying the person) and the conditions under which that action must occur. 
- However, while it does reflect the necessary components, it fails to clearly separate the preconditions from the main statement. It combines multiple conditions (the disclosure of PHI and the instruction from the individual) into a single complex statement, which might make it harder to extract atomic statements effectively.
- The phrasing may lead to ambiguity regarding the sequence and conditions involved.

**Choice 2:**
- This option explicitly identifies the components of the legal statement: the subject (HIC), the modal verb (shall), the action (notify), and the precondition (if). 
- It captures the essential structure of the legal requirement, ensuring that the preconditions are clearly linked to the action. 
- This clarity allows for easier analysis and understanding of the conditions under which HIC must notify, making it more aligned with the criteria for extracting atomic statements and preconditions.

**Choice 3:**
- This choice simplifies the original legal statement, omitting the first condition regarding the disclosure of PHI. 
- While it does maintain the precondition related to the instruction of the individual, it fails to capture the full context of the law. 
- By leaving out the reference to the disclosure, it does not meet Criterion 1 effectively, as it does not represent the complete set of atomic statements derived from the law article.

Based on this analysis, while Choice 1 and Choice 3 have their merits, Choice 2 stands out by clearly outlining the structure of the statement while maintaining both criteria effectively.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the choices based on the provided criteria, we will analyze each option in detail.

### Choice 1:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of the fact if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This statement captures the action of notifying and identifies HIC as the focal actor. However, it lacks clarity and precision in separating atomic statements and conditions.
- **Criterion 2:** The statement correctly identifies the preconditions (the two "if" clauses) that must be satisfied for the action to take place.

### Choice 2:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. **HIC** (the subject) **shall notify** (modal verb) **the person to whom it makes the disclosure** (action) **if** (precondition) **an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.**

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice clearly identifies HIC as the focal actor and the action to notify, but it is overly verbose and convoluted. It does not effectively break down the legal statement into atomic parts.
- **Criterion 2:** It accurately incorporates the preconditions with the "if" clauses but makes it difficult to parse due to its complexity.

### Choice 3:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice succinctly identifies HIC as the actor and the action to notify, making it clearer and more direct. However, it omits the condition regarding the disclosure of PHI about the individual.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is clearly stated, as it specifies the condition under which HIC must notify the person.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analyses, Choice 3 is the most effective in presenting a clear and concise atomic legal statement while still capturing the necessary precondition. Though it omits one of the conditions present in the original clause, it remains the most clear and relevant for the focal actor's perspective.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

**Choice 1:**
- This choice provides a comprehensive statement that captures the obligation of the HIC to notify a person when certain conditions are met. 
- **Criterion 1:** The statement includes the actor (HIC) and their obligation to notify, which aligns well with extracting atomic statements from the law article.
- **Criterion 2:** The preconditions are captured through the use of "if" in the statement. It specifies the conditions under which the notification must occur: if the HIC discloses PHI and if the individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing necessary PHI.
- **Conclusion:** This choice adequately fulfills both criteria.

**Choice 2:**
- This choice attempts to break down the statement into its components, identifying the subject, the modal verb, and the action, while also indicating the precondition with "if."
- **Criterion 1:** While it identifies the HIC and their obligation, the structure is somewhat convoluted and may not clearly represent an atomic statement as intended. The breakdown does not create a single clear legal statement; rather, it is more of a dissection of the original clause.
- **Criterion 2:** It does mention the precondition but does so in a way that adds complexity without enhancing clarity.
- **Conclusion:** This choice does not effectively deliver a clear atomic statement and is less effective at meeting the criteria.

**Choice 3:**
- This choice simplifies the statement by focusing on the notification obligation of the HIC.
- **Criterion 1:** It captures the essential atomic statement well, focusing on the legal obligation of the HIC.
- **Criterion 2:** However, it omits one of the key components of the original clause—the requirement that the HIC's notification is conditional on two specific "if" clauses, which limits its completeness.
- **Conclusion:** While clear, it does not fully satisfy the requirement regarding the preconditions.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that Choice 1 best meets both criteria, providing a clear and complete atomic statement while effectively incorporating the necessary preconditions.

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Action Description**: The action is described as "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure." This part of the statement does not include any preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
- **Classification**: The statement classifies the action as an obligation, which is correct according to the requirement.
- **Precondition Description**: The preconditions are explicitly stated, but they are included in the description of the action, which violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Action Description**: The action is the same as in Choice 1: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure." However, it again includes "if" indicating preconditions, violating Criterion 1.
- **Classification**: The classification is accurate, as it identifies the action as an obligation.
- **Precondition Description**: The preconditions are still mentioned in the statement, which does not align with the requirement to exclude preconditions from the description of actions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Action Description**: The action description remains unchanged: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure." It also includes "if," indicating preconditions, which violates Criterion 1.
- **Classification**: Similar to previous choices, it correctly identifies the action as an obligation.
- **Precondition Description**: The preconditions are once again included, failing to adhere to Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 because they all include preconditions in the description of actions. However, they all correctly classify the atomic legal statement as an obligation. Since there are no choices that fully satisfy both criteria, they are all flawed in the same way.

Given that none of the choices can be deemed correct without modifications, if forced to select the best among them based on the clarity of the action description and the obligation classification, I would conclude:

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
    - The statement includes "if" as a precondition, thereby violating Criterion 1 which specifies that action descriptions should not include preconditions.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
    - The classification identifies the action as an obligation. However, the presence of the precondition renders it inappropriate.

**Choice 2:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
    - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also uses "if" as a precondition. This violates Criterion 1.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
    - The classification process correctly identifies the action as an obligation, but again, it fails due to the presence of the precondition.

**Choice 3:**
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
    - This choice also includes "if" as a precondition, which violates Criterion 1.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
    - The classification here also correctly identifies the action as an obligation, but it still suffers from the same issue of including a precondition.

After analyzing all three choices, it is clear that they all include preconditions in the description of actions, thus violating Criterion 1. None of the choices meet the criteria adequately, as they all contain similar flaws.

Therefore, considering that none of the choices are satisfactory, the conclusion is:
"The best choice is 1" (as a default selection among equally flawed options).

- **Classification:** The action is correctly classified as an obligation ("shall notify").

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** It fails Criterion 1 as it includes a precondition in the action description.

---

**Choice 2:**
- **Action Description:** Similar to Choice 1, it states "the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure".
- **Precondition:** There is a clear precondition as per the same wording as above: "if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing...".
- **Classification:** The action is also classified as an obligation.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** It also fails Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of a precondition in the action description.

---

**Choice 3:**
- **Action Description:** Again, it states "the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure".
- **Precondition:** This choice has the same precondition stated: "if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing...".
- **Classification:** The action is classified as an obligation.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** It too fails Criterion 1, as it includes a precondition in the action description.

After analyzing all choices, they all share the same flaws. They include a precondition in the action description, violating Criterion 1. 

Given that none of the choices meet the criteria for a valid legal statement model, we can’t select a best choice among them. However, if we were to choose based on the order of presentation, we would have to select the first option.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Inclusion**: The description of the action includes a precondition: "if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary...". This violates Criterion 1 since the action cannot include preconditions.
   
2. **Classification of Legal Statement**: The obligation is correctly identified, and the action is clearly stated as "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure". However, since the precondition is included in the statement, this choice is not valid.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Inclusion**: Similar to Choice 1, the action includes the precondition in the phrasing. The phrase "if an HIC discloses PHI..." implies a precondition and thus violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Legal Statement**: The obligation and action are correctly identified, but due to the inclusion of the precondition, this choice does not meet the criteria.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Inclusion**: Again, this choice suffers from the same issue as the previous choices. The action includes the precondition: "if an HIC discloses PHI...". This means it also violates Criterion 1.

2. **Classification of Legal Statement**: The obligation is correctly identified, and the action is clearly stated. However, the violation of Criterion 1 renders this choice invalid.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 due to the inclusion of preconditions in the description of actions. Therefore, none of the choices are valid based on the criteria provided.

However, since the task requires a conclusion with a choice, and all choices are fundamentally flawed in the same manner, it is appropriate to state that the best choice is **none**. 

The best choice is 0 (indicating none of the provided choices are valid).
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - This choice includes an action that contains a precondition ("if an HIC discloses PHI..."). 
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**:
  - The classification of the action as an obligation is correct. However, the inclusion of preconditions directly in the action description violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 2:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also includes a precondition within the action description, which violates Criterion 1.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**:
  - The classification is accurate, but the violation of Criterion 1 remains an issue.

### Choice 3:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Like Choices 1 and 2, this choice also includes a precondition within the action description, violating Criterion 1.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**:
  - The classification of obligation is correct, but again, the presence of the precondition in the action description fails to meet Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All choices fail to meet Criterion 1 because they all include preconditions in the action description. However, all three choices do correctly classify the action as an obligation. Since none of the choices conform to the criteria adequately, there isn't a distinct "best" choice among them.

Given that all choices are equivalent in their shortcomings, it would be appropriate to indicate that no choice fulfills the criteria. However, if forced to choose among them without any clear distinction, the conclusion would be as follows:

The best choice is 1.

Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extraction of Statements**: The extraction correctly identifies HIC as the subject, "shall notify" as the modal verb, and the precondition notifies the person based on a detailed condition involving PHI disclosure.
- **Intentional Elements**: 
  - The first intentional element (notifyPerson) is indeed of type Goal with modality Obligation.
  - The second intentional element (preconditionDisclosure) is of type Goal with modality Precondition.
- **Dependencies**: There is a Dependency linking the precondition to the obligation, which satisfies the criteria that the source must be a Precondition and the target must be an Obligation.
- **Duplication**: No duplication of descriptions is present; both intentional elements have distinct descriptions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extraction of Statements**: This choice mirrors the first choice in extraction, correctly identifying the same components.
- **Intentional Elements**: 
  - The intentional elements are formatted similarly, with the first being an Obligation and the second being a Precondition.
- **Dependencies**: The Dependency links the precondition to the obligation appropriately, adhering to the criteria.
- **Duplication**: There is potential duplication in the descriptions due to the formatting. The lack of unique descriptions in the internal structure could lead to confusion in a larger model context.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extraction of Statements**: This choice also correctly identifies the components but includes slight variations in capitalization and wording.
- **Intentional Elements**: 
  - The first intentional element is an Obligation, but the description uses "Notify" instead of "notify," which could be seen as a stylistic inconsistency.
  - The second intentional element's description is slightly altered but still conveys the same meaning.
- **Dependencies**: The Dependency correctly connects the precondition to the obligation as required.
- **Duplication**: While the two intentional elements are similar, the descriptions vary slightly in wording, yet they still represent the same underlying legal statement.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all choices:
- **Choice 1** stands out as the only option that maintains clear, distinct descriptions for each intentional element while conforming strictly to all criteria without any stylistic discrepancies or potential confusion. Choices 2 and 3 introduce minor issues with duplication and description consistency that could lead to misunderstandings in a broader context.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: The model identifies a Precondition (preconditionDisclosure) as the source of a Dependency. This meets Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The Dependency links the Precondition to an Obligation (notifyPerson), fulfilling Criterion 2. The source is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplicate model elements with the same description in this choice. Each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: This model also correctly identifies a Precondition (IE2) as the source of a Dependency, satisfying Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The Dependency correctly connects the Precondition (IE2) to an Obligation (IE1), thereby fulfilling Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There is no duplication in the intentional elements; they are defined uniquely.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Precondition Source**: This model similarly identifies a Precondition (IE2) as the source of a Dependency, thus meeting Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The Dependency links the Precondition (IE2) to the Obligation (IE1), which satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: However, there is a notable issue in this choice. The description of the intentional elements is very similar to that in Choice 1 and Choice 2 but has slight variations in capitalization and phrasing. This raises concerns about potential duplication of model elements as the descriptions are effectively the same in legal context.

### Conclusion

After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria provided, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 are valid. However, Choice 3 presents a potential issue with duplication due to the slight variations in element descriptions that do not introduce any new semantics. 

Thus, the best choice is Choice 1, which has no issues with element duplication and meets all criteria effectively.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: A «Precondition» (preconditionDisclosure) is established. It has modality Precondition and serves as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is preconditionDisclosure (a «Precondition»), and the target is notifyPerson (an «Obligation»). This fulfills the requirement that the target of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» or an «Permission».
3. **Criterion 3**: The model does not contain any duplicated elements with the same description. Each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: A «Precondition» (IE2) is present and serves as the source of a Dependency, satisfying the first criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is IE2 (a «Precondition»), and the target is IE1 (an «Obligation»). This meets the requirement for a valid dependency.
3. **Criterion 3**: There is no duplication of model elements with the same description. Each element has a distinct identifier and description.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: A «Precondition» (IE2) is also established in this model, serving as the source of a Dependency.
2. **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is IE2 (a «Precondition»), and the target is IE1 (an «Obligation»). This is in compliance with the requirement.
3. **Criterion 3**: The first and second intentional elements have similar descriptions to those in Choice 1. While the wording is slightly different (capitalization and phrasing), the essential information is the same, leading to a duplication issue.

### Conclusion:
Choice 1 and Choice 2 both satisfy all the criteria without any issues, while Choice 3 fails to meet Criterion 3 due to potential duplication of model elements. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: The model has a precondition intentional element identified as `preconditionDisclosure`, which is a Goal with modality Precondition. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source of the dependency is `preconditionDisclosure`, and the target is `notifyPerson`. The target is an Obligation, which satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: The model elements have unique descriptions. There are no duplications, satisfying Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: This choice meets all criteria.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: The precondition intentional element is also identified as `IE2`, which is of type Goal with modality Precondition. This satisfies Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The source of the dependency is `IE2`, and the target is `IE1`, which is an Obligation. This also satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: The descriptions for the intentional elements are identical to those in Choice 1 but are assigned different IDs (`IE1` and `IE2`). However, the descriptions are essentially the same, which introduces potential confusion and violates Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: This choice meets Criteria 1 and 2 but fails Criterion 3 due to potential duplication and confusion.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: The precondition intentional element is identified as `IE2`, which has modality Precondition. This meets Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependency links `IE2` (source) to `IE1` (target), where `IE1` is an Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: The descriptions for `IE1` and `IE2` are similar to those in Choice 2, but they differ slightly in capitalization and phrasing. However, they essentially convey the same meanings, indicating potential duplication, which violates Criterion 3.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: This choice meets Criteria 1 and 2 but fails Criterion 3 due to the similarity in descriptions leading to potential duplication.

---

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is clear that **Choice 1** is the only one that satisfies all three criteria without any potential issues of duplication or confusion. 

The best choice is **1**.

 To analyze the choices based on the given criteria, let's break down each choice in detail.

### Choice 1:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
- Subject (HIC) has an obligation to notify the person if specific conditions (preconditions) are met.

**Model Elements:**
- **Actor:** HIC
- **Intentional Elements:**
  - `notifyPerson` (Goal, Obligation)
  - `preconditionDisclosure` (Goal, Precondition)

**Element Links:**
- Dependency from `preconditionDisclosure` to `notifyPerson`.

**Evaluation against criteria:**
1. **Criterion 1:** The source of the dependency (`preconditionDisclosure`) is a Goal with modality Precondition. **(Meets Criterion)**
2. **Criterion 2:** The source is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation. **(Meets Criterion)**
3. **Criterion 3:** No duplication of model elements with the same description. **(Meets Criterion)**

### Choice 2:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
- Similar extraction as Choice 1.

**Model Elements:**
- **Actor:** HIC
- **Intentional Elements:**
  - `IE1` (Goal, Obligation)
  - `IE2` (Goal, Precondition)

**Element Links:**
- Dependency from `IE2` to `IE1`.

**Evaluation against criteria:**
1. **Criterion 1:** The source of the dependency (`IE2`) is a Goal with modality Precondition. **(Meets Criterion)**
2. **Criterion 2:** The source is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation. **(Meets Criterion)**
3. **Criterion 3:** No duplication of model elements with the same description. **(Meets Criterion)**

### Choice 3:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
- Similar extraction as previous choices.

**Model Elements:**
- **Actor:** HIC
- **Intentional Elements:**
  - `IE1` (Goal, Obligation)
  - `IE2` (Goal, Precondition)

**Element Links:**
- Dependency from `IE2` to `IE1`.

**Evaluation against criteria:**
1. **Criterion 1:** The source of the dependency (`IE2`) is a Goal with modality Precondition. **(Meets Criterion)**
2. **Criterion 2:** The source is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation. **(Meets Criterion)**
3. **Criterion 3:** There is a duplication of model elements. The descriptions in Choice 3 use different casing but are fundamentally the same as those in Choice 1 and Choice 2. **(Does not meet Criterion)**

### Conclusion:
Choice 3 fails to meet Criterion 3 due to duplication in descriptions. Choices 1 and 2 both meet all criteria, but they present the same information in slightly different formats. However, Choice 1 maintains a clear structure without nested elements and is easier to read.

Thus, the best choice is **1**.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) If an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) (a) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual, the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of that fact.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

   - B: an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   
   The propositional logic formula is:
   - P: A and B

2. **Syntax Tree:**
```

3. **Sub Intentional Elements:**
   - P_A: an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1).
   - P_B: an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   - P_AND: an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

4. **Decompositions:**
   - The original IntentionalElement `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into `P_A` and `P_B` with an 'AND' decomposition.

5. **Contribution Links:**
   - The `notifyPerson` element is impacted by the `preconditionDisclosure` with a level of 100, indicating that if the preconditions are satisfied, the obligation to notify is satisfied.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
1. **Analyze the Precondition**:
   - A: an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1).
   - B: an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

   The propositional logic formula becomes:
   ```
   A and B
   ```

2. **Create the Syntax Tree**:
   ```
       AND
      /    \
     A      B
   ```

3. **Create Sub IntentionalElements**:
   - P_A: an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1).
   - P_B: an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   - P_AND: an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) and an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

4. **Connect Original IntentionalElement to Sub IntentionalElements**:
```

```

In this refined model, we have broken down the precondition into its components, established the necessary dependencies and decompositions, and ensured that the original obligations and preconditions are clearly defined and logically connected.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the overall effectiveness of the Legal GRL model in capturing the legal obligations described in the law article.

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The precondition `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into two sub-elements, `P_A` and `P_B`, which are both of the same type (Precondition). This satisfies Criterion 1.
   - Both sub-elements are necessary to fulfill the original precondition, thus satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Modeling**: 
   - The model effectively captures the relationship between the precondition and the obligation to notify. The impact of the precondition on the obligation is well-defined.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The precondition `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into sub-elements `P_A` and `P_AND_B_OR`, where `P_AND_B_OR` further decomposes into `P_B` and `P_OR_C_D`. This introduces a level of complexity that might not be required and mixes different modalities (Precondition and Goal). This violates Criterion 1 since `P_AND_B_OR` is not purely a Precondition.
   - The model's complexity may lead to confusion, and it does not clearly define the relationships among the components.

2. **Modeling**: 
   - While it provides a comprehensive view, the additional complexity may detract from clarity.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The precondition is decomposed into `precondition_A` and `precondition_B`, both of which are Preconditions. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   - The model captures the necessary components of the obligation and maintains clarity. 

2. **Modeling**: 
   - The relationships are well-defined, with dependencies established between the preconditions and the obligation to notify. However, this model could have benefited from additional clarity on how the preconditions relate to each other.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices based on the criteria, we find that:

- **Choice 1** effectively balances clarity and completeness without introducing unnecessary complexity, adhering strictly to the criteria for decomposition and targeting.
- **Choice 2** introduces complexity that could confuse rather than clarify the relationships and violates the decomposition criterion.
- **Choice 3** meets the criteria but lacks the clarity in showing how the preconditions interact.

Thus, the best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
- **Decomposition:** The precondition `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into two sub-elements, `P_A` and `P_B`, which are both classified as Precondition IntentionalElements. This adheres to Criterion 1 as both decomposed elements are of the same type and modality.
- **Target of Decomposition:** The decomposition leads to two targets (`P_A` and `P_B`), thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2:
- **Decomposition:** The precondition `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into `P_A` and `P_AND_B_OR`, where `P_AND_B_OR` itself involves further logical conditions (AND and OR). This decomposition correctly maintains the same type and modality, adhering to Criterion 1.
- **Target of Decomposition:** The decomposition leads to two targets (`P_A` and `P_AND_B_OR`), fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3:
- **Decomposition:** The precondition `preconditionDisclosure` is decomposed into `precondition_A` and `precondition_B`, both of which are Precondition IntentionalElements. This meets Criterion 1 as they are of the same type and modality.
- **Target of Decomposition:** The decomposition targets two elements (`precondition_A` and `precondition_B`), thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
All choices meet the criteria, but they differ in complexity and the depth of analysis related to the decomposition of the preconditions. Choice 2 provides a more detailed decomposition that captures additional logical structures (AND and OR scenarios) in the precondition, making it more comprehensive for legal reasoning. However, the model may become overly complex, which could hinder clarity. 

Choice 1 and Choice 3 present simpler models that are easier to understand and maintain while still fulfilling the decomposition and target criteria. Given the need for clarity and adherence to the criteria, **Choice 3** offers a balanced approach, maintaining simplicity without excessive complexity.

**The best choice is 3.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria for the domain model aimed at generating Legal GRL models from law articles, particularly from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

### Analysis of Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- **Decomposition:** The model correctly decomposes `preconditionDisclosure` into two sub-elements, `P_A` and `P_B`, both of which are of the same type (Precondition). This adheres to Criterion 1.
- **Multiplicity:** The decomposition satisfies Criterion 2 as it results in more than one Intentional Element.
- **Structure:** The model maintains clarity in linking preconditions to the obligation to notify, but it doesn't expand on further detailed dependencies or additional conditional logic that could enhance the model.

**Choice 2:**
- **Decomposition:** This choice also decomposes `preconditionDisclosure` into multiple components. However, the tree structure becomes quite complex with several levels of AND and OR decompositions.
- **Criterion Compliance:** While it maintains the same type in decompositions, the complexity could lead to confusion, making it less intuitive when determining the relationships between elements. The model does satisfy both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 but strays into excessive complexity.
- **Detailing:** It provides more granularity; however, the interdependencies and the number of Intentional Elements could overwhelm users trying to grasp the model quickly.

**Choice 3:**
- **Decomposition:** Similar to Choice 1, this choice decomposes the precondition into two sub-elements, ensuring they remain of the same type and modality, thus adhering to Criterion 1.
- **Multiplicity:** It meets Criterion 2 as it results in multiple Intentional Elements.
- **Clarity:** This choice maintains a clearer and simpler structure compared to Choice 2, making it easy to understand and follow. However, it lacks the depth provided in Choice 2.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing each choice, it is clear that while Choice 2 offers a more detailed breakdown of the preconditions, its complexity could hinder practicality and usability. Choice 1 and Choice 3 provide simpler models that adhere to the criteria well, but Choice 1 offers slightly more depth without overwhelming complexity.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice against the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - Decomposes the `preconditionDisclosure` into `P_A` and `P_B`, both classified as `Preconditions`. This aligns with **Criterion 1**.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition targets two elements, `P_A` and `P_B`, which satisfies **Criterion 2**.

3. **Overall Evaluation**:
   - This choice adheres to the criteria set forth and maintains clarity in modeling the obligations and preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - The model decomposes `preconditionDisclosure` into `P_A` and `P_AND_B_OR`. However, `P_AND_B_OR` has not been explicitly defined as an intentional element of the same modality (specifically, it is a mix of obligations and preconditions). This violates **Criterion 1**.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Targets `P_A` and `P_AND_B_OR`, which is acceptable. However, the issues with validity in decomposition overshadow this aspect.

3. **Overall Evaluation**:
   - Due to the violations of **Criterion 1**, this choice is less desirable.

### Choice 3:
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - Decomposes `preconditionDisclosure` into `precondition_A` and `precondition_B`, both classified as `Preconditions`. This adheres to **Criterion 1**.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition targets two elements, which satisfies **Criterion 2**.

3. **Overall Evaluation**:
   - This choice effectively meets both criteria and provides a clear representation of the legal obligations and preconditions.

### Final Decision:
Comparing the three choices, **Choice 1** and **Choice 3** both meet the criteria effectively. However, **Choice 1** provides a more straightforward decomposition without additional complexity introduced by intermediate elements. 

Therefore, the best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
1. **Decomposition:** The decomposition of `preconditionDisclosure` into `P_A` and `P_B` adheres to Criterion 1, as both sub-elements are of the same modality (Precondition). However, Criterion 2 may not be satisfied, as the decomposition does not create a clear distinct set of Intentional Elements beyond the original precondition.
   
2. **Intentional Elements and Links:** The model effectively links the `preconditionDisclosure` to `notifyPerson` using a dependency link, which is valid as it indicates that the obligation to notify is contingent upon the preconditions being satisfied.

3. **Final Model Validity:** The final model meets the criteria, but the decomposition may lack clarity in the intention behind the elements.

**Choice 2:**
1. **Decomposition:** The decomposition into several sub-elements (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, etc.) is extensive and complicated. While it attempts to break down the precondition into more granular elements, it may violate Criterion 1 as it mixes modalities through complex dependencies and linkages.

2. **Intentional Elements and Links:** The use of OR and AND decompositions is valid, but the complexity may lead to confusion and potential misinterpretation of the original legal text.

3. **Final Model Validity:** The model effectively captures the details of the legal obligation, but due to its complexity, it risks violating the criteria related to intentionality and clarity.

**Choice 3:**
1. **Decomposition:** The decomposition of `preconditionDisclosure` into `precondition_A` and `precondition_B` maintains the integrity of Criterion 1, as both are Precondition types. It also meets Criterion 2 by ensuring that the decomposition leads to distinct Intentional Elements.

2. **Intentional Elements and Links:** The model maintains a clear and logical flow, linking the preconditions directly to the obligation without introducing unnecessary complexity.

3. **Final Model Validity:** This model effectively captures the essence of the legal requirement while adhering to the criteria, ensuring clarity and intentionality.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all choices, it is clear that Choice 3 maintains the best balance of clarity, adherence to the stated criteria, and logical structure without unnecessary complexity. 

The best choice is **3**.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

- **Criterion 1:** This statement extracts an atomic legal statement but doesn't specify the source of the instruction (i.e., it does not mention clause (1)(a)). This could lead to ambiguity regarding which instruction applies.
- **Criterion 2:** The condition is correctly framed as it starts with "if," indicating the precondition for the notification. 

### Choice 2:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

- **Criterion 1:** This statement clearly specifies that the instruction must be made under clause (1)(a), which is crucial for clarity and precision in legal terms.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is also correctly indicated with "if," fulfilling the requirement.

### Choice 3:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, this statement does not specify that the instruction must be made under clause (1)(a), leading to potential ambiguity.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is correctly framed, as it starts with "if."

### Conclusion:
While all choices correctly address the precondition criteria, Choices 1 and 3 lack specificity regarding the source of the instruction, making them less precise. Choice 2 stands out as it includes the necessary reference to clause (1)(a), ensuring clarity regarding the source of the instruction and fulfilling both criteria effectively.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the three choices for extracting atomic legal statements from the given law article, we will analyze each option based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This statement captures the action that HIC must take (notification) and the condition under which it must act (the individual’s instruction). However, it does not specify that the instruction is made under clause (1)(a), which could mean it's missing context from the original legal text.
- **Criterion 2:** The condition stated here (“if an individual’s instruction prevents...”) corresponds to the "if" clause in the original text, indicating a valid precondition.

### Choice 2:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** This statement correctly identifies the instruction as being made under clause (1)(a), providing a more precise context that aligns with the original law article. It is a complete and accurate atomic statement from the perspective of HIC.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is accurately captured, reflecting the structure of the original article.

### Choice 3:
**Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, this statement captures the essence of HIC's obligation, but it fails to specify that the instruction is made under clause (1)(a). This omission could lead to a misunderstanding of the conditions under which HIC is required to notify.
- **Criterion 2:** The condition is appropriately represented, corresponding to the original text's "if" clause.

### Conclusion
Upon analyzing all three choices, Choice 2 stands out as the most comprehensive and accurate option. It captures the necessity of the instruction being made under clause (1)(a), which is crucial for understanding HIC's obligations. Therefore, the best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Atomic Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: This choice extracts the atomic statement from the perspective of the HIC. However, it does not explicitly reference the specific clause (1)(a) that provides important context for the instruction.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is correctly identified with the "if" clause concerning the individual’s instruction.

### Choice 2:
- **Atomic Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: This choice accurately captures the atomic statement and includes the specific reference to clause (1)(a), making it clearer and more precise from the focal actor's perspective.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is also well-defined with the "if" clause, clearly linking the instruction to the legal obligation to notify.

### Choice 3:
- **Atomic Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice lacks the explicit reference to clause (1)(a), which is crucial for full understanding.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is correctly identified with the "if" clause, similar to Choices 1 and 2.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices based on the criteria, Choice 2 stands out as the best option. It effectively captures the atomic statement while also including the reference to clause (1)(a), which is critical for understanding the context of the instruction. Thus, the best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the choices regarding the extraction of atomic legal statements from the law article, we need to analyze how well each choice adheres to the specified criteria.

### Evaluation of Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Statement:** "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Analysis:**
  - **Criterion 1:** This statement extracts an atomic statement from the perspective of HIC, correctly identifying the notification obligation relevant to PHI.
  - **Criterion 2:** It captures the conditional nature ('if an individual’s instruction prevents...') but misses the specific reference to clause (1)(a) that indicates the context of the instruction.
  
**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Statement:** "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Analysis:**
  - **Criterion 1:** This statement also identifies the notification obligation regarding PHI from HIC's perspective.
  - **Criterion 2:** It accurately incorporates the reference to clause (1)(a), which is critical for understanding the conditions under which HIC must notify. This enhances the clarity regarding the context of the instruction.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Statement:** "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Analysis:**
  - **Criterion 1:** Similar to the first choice, this statement captures the obligation from HIC’s perspective.
  - **Criterion 2:** Like Choice 1, it fails to mention the specific clause (1)(a), which is critical for understanding the precise conditions for notification.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, **Choice 2** stands out as the best option because it effectively satisfies both criteria by clearly stating the obligation of HIC while also incorporating the necessary context of clause (1)(a). This ensures that the extracted legal statement is both precise and relevant.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an individual’s instruction prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: This choice does extract an atomic statement from the law article, but it generalizes the instruction to "an individual’s instruction," which does not specify that the instruction must be made under clause (1)(a). This could lead to ambiguity in the context of the law.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is correctly identified, as it starts with "if," but it lacks specificity regarding the clause from which the instruction originates.

### Choice 2:
- **Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: This choice accurately captures the requirement that the instruction must be made under clause (1)(a), thus making it a precise atomic statement. It aligns well with the legal text.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is correctly extracted, starting with "if," and it specifies the source of the instruction, maintaining clarity regarding the condition under which the notification obligation arises.

### Choice 3:
- **Statement**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
- **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice generalizes the instruction to "an instruction of the individual," failing to include the specificity of clause (1)(a). This may lead to potential legal misinterpretations.
- **Criterion 2**: The precondition is correctly identified and starts with "if," but it lacks the necessary specificity regarding the source of the instruction.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the criteria provided, Choice 2 stands out as the most precise and comprehensive. It extracts the atomic statement correctly and includes the necessary preconditions along with specificity about the source of the instruction.

The best choice is 2.

 Let's analyze each choice according to the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** includes a precondition that describes an instruction of the individual.

**Analysis:** This choice does not meet Criterion 1 because it includes a description of a precondition.

### Choice 2:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** includes a description of a precondition.

**Analysis:** This choice also fails to satisfy Criterion 1 since it contains a description of a precondition.

### Choice 3:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** includes a description of a precondition.

**Analysis:** Similar to the first two choices, this choice also does not meet Criterion 1 because it includes a description of a precondition.

### Conclusion:
None of the choices meet both criteria as all of them include a precondition in their classifications. However, if we must select the best choice among them based on the common characteristics, they are all identical in terms of content. Since they all fail Criterion 1, it can be concluded that they are equally inadequate. Based on the analysis, the best choice is choice 1, as it is the first instance of the statement. 

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Actor: HIC
  - Modal Verb: shall
  - Modality: Obligation
  - Action(s): notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - Precondition(s): The description includes a precondition regarding the instruction of the individual preventing disclosure of PHI.

**Analysis**: This choice fails Criterion 1 because it includes a precondition in the description of the action.

### Choice 2:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Actor: HIC
  - Modal Verb: shall
  - Modality: Obligation
  - Action(s): notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - Precondition(s): The description includes a precondition as before.

**Analysis**: This choice also fails Criterion 1 for the same reason as Choice 1, as it includes a precondition.

### Choice 3:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
  - Actor: HIC
  - Modal Verb: shall
  - Modality: Obligation
  - Action(s): notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - Precondition(s): The description includes a precondition.

**Analysis**: This choice fails Criterion 1 as well, as it also includes a precondition.

### Conclusion:
All three choices provide the same information and fail to meet Criterion 1, as they each describe the action with preconditions. Therefore, none of the choices satisfy both criteria.

However, since they equally fail to meet the criteria, we can conclude that they are all equivalent in their shortcomings. Given the context that all choices are flawed in the same way, we can technically select any of them. 

Thus, "The best choice is 1" (as it is the first choice listed).

### Choice 1:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** The inclusion of the precondition about the instruction of the individual prevents compliance with Criterion 1.

### Choice 2:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** Again, the precondition is included, which violates Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** The statement is correctly extracted.
- **Classification and Formatting:**
  - **Actor:** HIC
  - **Modal Verb:** shall
  - **Modality:** Obligation
  - **Action(s):** notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure
  - **Precondition(s):** The precondition is still present, violating Criterion 1.

In all three choices, the preconditions are described, which contradicts Criterion 1. However, since all choices provide the same information and violate the same criteria, there is no clear winner based on the provided choices. 

Since all choices are equivalent in their failures to meet the criteria, I conclude with the following:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - The statement extracted is accurate.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
  - The actor (HIC) is correctly identified.
  - The modal verb "shall" indicates an obligation.
  - The action "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure" is properly stated.
  - **Precondition(s):** This explicitly mentions a condition that needs to be met for the action to take place, violating Criterion 1.

### Choice 2:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - The same statement is extracted correctly.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
  - The actor (HIC) is identified correctly.
  - The modal verb "shall" indicates an obligation.
  - The action "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure" is correctly stated.
  - **Precondition(s):** Again, this includes a precondition that must be met for the action to occur, violating Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
- **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:** 
  - The statement is accurately extracted.
- **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:**
  - The actor (HIC) is correctly identified.
  - The modal verb "shall" indicates an obligation.
  - The action "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure" is properly stated.
  - **Precondition(s):** This choice also includes a precondition, which violates Criterion 1.

### Conclusion:
All three choices have the same issues regarding the inclusion of preconditions, which violates Criterion 1. However, all choices correctly identify the obligation and action associated with HIC. Given that all choices are fundamentally the same and violate the same criterion, none can be deemed better than the others based on the provided information.

The best choice is 1 (as it is the first presented option).

 Analyzing the provided choices in detail with respect to the specified criteria:

**Choice 1:**
- **Action Description**: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure..."
- **Precondition**: The choice includes a precondition stating, "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary...".
- **Classification**: The legal statement is classified correctly as an obligation.

**Criterion Evaluation**:
1. **Criterion 1**: Violates this criterion since the description of the action includes a precondition.
2. **Criterion 2**: Correctly classifies the statement as an obligation.

**Choice 2:**
- **Action Description**: Same as Choice 1.
- **Precondition**: Also includes the same precondition.
- **Classification**: The legal statement is classified correctly as an obligation.

**Criterion Evaluation**:
1. **Criterion 1**: Violates this criterion for the same reason as Choice 1.
2. **Criterion 2**: Correctly classifies the statement as an obligation.

**Choice 3:**
- **Action Description**: Also the same as the previous choices.
- **Precondition**: Like the others, it includes a precondition.
- **Classification**: This statement is classified as an obligation.

**Criterion Evaluation**:
1. **Criterion 1**: Violates this criterion as it includes the precondition.
2. **Criterion 2**: Correctly classifies the statement as an obligation.

**Conclusion**:
All choices suffer from the same issue regarding Criterion 1 as they all include a precondition in the action description. However, each choice correctly identifies the legal statement as an obligation. Since none of the choices meet the criteria fully, they are all inadequate. However, all choices are equally flawed, leading to the conclusion that they are equally unsatisfactory.

Given that they are all structurally the same, we can select any choice. The best choice is **1**.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extracted Statement**: The statement accurately reflects the legal obligation of HIC.
2. **Classification**: 
   - The actor is correctly identified as HIC.
   - The obligation is correctly classified with the modal verb "shall".
   - The precondition is correctly identified.
3. **Modeling**:
   - There are two IntentionalElements: one for the Obligation and one for the Precondition.
   - The Dependency is correctly established with the Precondition (IE2) as the source and the Obligation (IE1) as the target.

**Criteria Check**:
- **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency (IE2) is a Precondition, which is correct.
- **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation, which complies.
- **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements.

### Choice 2:
1. **Extracted Statement**: The statement is the same as in Choice 1.
2. **Classification**: 
   - The actor, modal verb, and types of intentional elements are classified correctly.
3. **Modeling**:
   - There are two IntentionalElements, and the Dependency is established correctly.

**Criteria Check**:
- **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency (IE2) is a Precondition, which is correct.
- **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation, which complies.
- **Criterion 3**: There are no duplications of model elements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extracted Statement**: The statement is the same as in Choices 1 and 2.
2. **Classification**: 
   - The actor, modal verb, and types of intentional elements are classified correctly.
3. **Modeling**:
   - The model structure is slightly different, as it nests IntentionalElements within each other, which is not the standard representation. Each IntentionalElement should be a separate entry in the list.

**Criteria Check**:
- **Criterion 1**: The source of the Dependency (IE2) is a Precondition, which is correct.
- **Criterion 2**: The source of the Dependency is a Precondition, and the target is an Obligation, which complies.
- **Criterion 3**: The nesting of IntentionalElements creates an ambiguity and may lead to confusion, as it appears to duplicate the structure visually, even if the descriptions are unique.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, Choices 1 and 2 both meet the criteria effectively without ambiguity or duplication issues. However, Choice 3 introduces a structural ambiguity through the nesting of IntentionalElements. Therefore, the best choice is:

**The best choice is 1.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To analyze the three choices provided, I will evaluate each one based on the specified criteria: 

### Choice 1:
1. **Precondition Source**: The model identifies the precondition (IE2) correctly as an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependency is correctly established with the source being the precondition (IE2) and the target being the obligation (IE1). This satisfies Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicated model elements; each description is unique.

### Choice 2:
1. **Precondition Source**: Similar to Choice 1, the precondition (IE2) is correctly identified as an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependency is correctly set up with IE2 as the source and IE1 as the target, satisfying Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicates in model elements.

### Choice 3:
1. **Precondition Source**: The precondition (IE2) is again correctly identified as an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The dependency is correctly established with IE2 as the source and IE1 as the target, satisfying Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: This choice has a significant issue where the structure mixes the elements incorrectly, causing a nested definition of IntentionalElement. This could lead to confusion and may violate Criterion 3 regarding the clarity and uniqueness of model elements.

### Conclusion:
Upon review, Choices 1 and 2 are structurally sound and meet all criteria without duplication. However, both Choices 1 and 2 are effectively the same in terms of content and correctness, while Choice 3 introduces structural confusion. Therefore, I will select the first choice as it is clear and well-structured.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the choices based on the provided criteria, I will analyze each choice in detail.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Extracted Statement**: Correctly captures the essence of the legal statement.
- **Actors and Elements**:
  - Actor: HIC is identified correctly.
  - Two intentional elements are created: 
    - IE1 (Obligation): "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure"
    - IE2 (Precondition): "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI..."
- **Element Links**:
  - Dependency correctly links IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation).
- **Criteria Check**:
  - **Criterion 1**: IE2 (Precondition) is the source of a Dependency → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 2**: IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation) → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 3**: No duplication of descriptions → **Met**.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Extracted Statement**: Same as Choice 1.
- **Actors and Elements**:
  - Actor: HIC is correctly identified.
  - Two intentional elements are created:
    - IE1 (Obligation): "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure"
    - IE2 (Precondition): "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI..."
- **Element Links**:
  - Dependency correctly links IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation).
- **Criteria Check**:
  - **Criterion 1**: IE2 (Precondition) is the source of a Dependency → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 2**: IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation) → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 3**: No duplication of descriptions → **Met**.
- **Formatting**: The format appears slightly different with indentation and structure, but the content and logic remain consistent with Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Extracted Statement**: Similar to the previous choices.
- **Actors and Elements**:
  - Actor: HIC is correctly identified.
  - However, the structure of the intentional elements is incorrect. It attempts to nest IntentionalElements, which is not a valid representation.
  - Two intentional elements should be separate, but in this choice, IE2 is incorrectly nested under IE1.
- **Element Links**:
  - Dependency is correctly linking IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation), but the model's structure is incorrect due to the nesting.
- **Criteria Check**:
  - **Criterion 1**: IE2 (Precondition) is the source of a Dependency → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 2**: IE2 (Precondition) to IE1 (Obligation) → **Met**.
  - **Criterion 3**: No duplication of descriptions → **Met**.
- **Structural Issue**: The nesting violates standard modeling practices, which could lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the model.

### Conclusion:
Both Choice 1 and Choice 2 adhere to the criteria and correctly model the legal statement. However, Choice 1 presents the model in a more straightforward and conventional format without unnecessary structural complications. Choice 2 is also valid but not as clear as Choice 1. Choice 3, while meeting most criteria, has a structural issue that undermines its validity.

Therefore, the best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction accurately reflects the legal requirement set forth in the law article.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**: 
   - The actor is correctly identified as HIC.
   - The obligation is clearly stated.
   - The precondition is appropriately detailed.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**: 
   - The actor model includes one obligation (IE1) and one precondition (IE2).
   - **Dependency**: The source of the dependency is IE2 (the precondition), and the target is IE1 (the obligation). This satisfies both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.
   - There is no duplication in the model elements. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, the extraction is accurate.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The classification remains consistent with the previous choice.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**:
   - The model structure is valid, with the actor and intentional elements correctly identified.
   - **Dependency**: The source (IE2) and target (IE1) are correctly identified, fulfilling Criteria 1 and 2.
   - However, there is a minor difference in the formatting style, but it does not impact the content or the structural validity. 
   - There is also no duplication.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is again accurate.
2. **Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The classification is consistent.
3. **Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL**: 
   - The actor model is incorrectly structured. The nested structure of `IntentionalElement` is not consistent with the expected format. 
   - **Dependency**: The source and target are correctly identified, so it meets Criteria 1 and 2, but the formatting is problematic.
   - There is no duplication in the model elements.

### Summary:
- Choice 1 and Choice 2 both meet all criteria without any structural issues or ambiguities.
- Choice 3, while also meeting the criteria for the dependency, has a problematic nested structure that can lead to confusion.

Based on the analysis, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 are valid, but they differ in formatting. Choice 1 is clearer and adheres to expected formatting conventions.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: 
   - The source of the Dependency is IE2, which is a Precondition. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source (IE2) is a Precondition, and the target (IE1) is an Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: 
   - There are no duplications in descriptions across the intentional elements. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: 
   - The source of the Dependency is IE2, which is a Precondition. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source (IE2) is a Precondition, and the target (IE1) is an Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: 
   - There are no duplications in descriptions across the intentional elements. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Dependency Source**: 
   - The source of the Dependency is IE2, which is a Precondition. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source (IE2) is a Precondition, and the target (IE1) is an Obligation. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: 
   - The format used has nested IntentionalElements, which could lead to ambiguity. However, there are no exact duplications of descriptions in the elements. This does not strictly violate Criterion 3 but may complicate the model's clarity.

### Conclusion:
All choices satisfy the first two criteria. However, Choice 1 and Choice 2 are clearer in terms of structure and avoid potential confusion found in Choice 3 due to its nested IntentionalElements. Between Choice 1 and Choice 2, they are identical in terms of content, but Choice 1 presents a slightly clearer format. Thus, after careful consideration of clarity and adherence to the criteria:

The best choice is 1.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) If an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) (a) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual, the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of that fact.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'
    'id:' id=ID
    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?
;

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

    'decompositionType:' decompositionType=decompositionType
;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
1. Analyze the Precondition (IE2): "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

This can be broken down into:
- A: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a).
- B: the custodian prevents disclosing all the PHI.
- C: the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose.
- D: the PHI is for the provision of health care.
- E: the PHI is for assisting in the provision of health care.

The propositional logic formula is:
A and (B or (C and (D or E)))

2. Construct syntax tree:
```
        AND
       /         A   OR
            /            B   AND
                /               C   OR
                              /   D   E
```

3. Create sub IntentionalElements:
- IE_A: "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a)."
- IE_B: "the custodian prevents disclosing all the PHI."
- IE_C: "the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose."
- IE_D: "the PHI is for the provision of health care."
- IE_E: "the PHI is for assisting in the provision of health care."
- IE_AND_B_OR: "the custodian prevents disclosing all the PHI or considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care."

4. Connect the original IntentionalElement to sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions:
```
Decomposition: 
    source: IE2
    target: IE_A, IE_AND_B_OR
    decompositionType: AND

Decomposition: 
    source: IE_AND_B_OR

    decompositionType: OR

Decomposition:

5. Create contribution links:
```

    source: IE_A
    target: IE2
    level: 100

Contribution: 
    source: IE_B
    target: IE2

### Refine Legal GRL model:  
To refine the existing Legal GRL model, we will analyze the precondition and obligation in propositional logic, build the syntax tree, create sub IntentionalElements, and establish appropriate Decompositions and Contributions.

1. **Precondition Analysis**:
   - Propositional Logic Formula:
     - P: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   - Breakdown:
     - A: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a).
     - B: the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI.
     - C: the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
  
   - Formula: A and (B and C)

2. **Syntax Tree**:
       AND
       /         A    AND
            /             B  C

3. **Sub IntentionalElements**:
   - P_A: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a).
   - P_B: the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI.
   - P_C: the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - P_AND_B_C: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) and the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.

4. **Decompositions**:
   - `IE2` decomposes into `P_A` and `P_AND_B_C` with an 'AND' Decomposition.
   - `P_AND_B_C` decomposes into `P_B` and `P_C` with an 'AND' Decomposition.

5. **Contribution Links**:
   - Contribution from `P_A` to `IE2` with level 100 (satisfaction of P_A ensures satisfaction of IE2).

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - The model decomposes the precondition (IE2) into multiple preconditions (IE3, IE4, IE5, IE6) and obligations (IE7). This violates Criterion 1 because the decomposition involves both preconditions and obligations.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The target of the decomposition from IE2 includes multiple intentional elements (IE3, IE4), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 1:
Choice 1 does not fully adhere to Criterion 1 due to the mixed modality in decomposition. Therefore, it is not the best choice.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - The model maintains a clear separation of intentional elements by type and modality. The precondition (IE2) decomposes into preconditions (IE_A and IE_AND_B_OR), which further decomposes into obligations (IE_B, IE_C) and maintains the separation of elements.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The target of the decomposition includes multiple intentional elements (IE_A and IE_AND_B_OR), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 2:
Choice 2 successfully meets both criteria, demonstrating a well-structured model. Thus, it is a strong candidate for the best choice.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, this model separates preconditions and maintains the integrity of modalities. The precondition (IE2) decomposes into preconditions (P_A and P_AND_B_C), which further decomposes into preconditions (P_B and P_C), adhering to Criterion 1.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The target of the decomposition involves multiple intentional elements (P_A and P_AND_B_C), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion for Choice 3:
Choice 3 also meets both criteria effectively, demonstrating a clear and organized model.

---

### Final Decision:
Both Choice 2 and Choice 3 are valid and meet the criteria. However, Choice 2 presents a more straightforward and concise structure, while Choice 3 involves additional complexity without significant added clarity.

In conclusion, the best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To analyze the three choices in the context of generating Legal GRL models from law articles, I will evaluate each choice against the provided criteria for decomposition and target Intentional Elements.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Validity**:
   - The model decomposes `IE2` (Precondition) into several Precondition elements (`IE3`, `IE4`, `IE5`, `IE6`, etc.), which adheres to Criterion 1, as all decomposed elements are of the same modality (Precondition).
   - The model also includes an Obligation (`IE1`), which depends on `IE2`. However, `IE2` is not decomposed into Obligation; thus, this aspect is valid.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of `IE2` into `[IE3, IE4]` satisfies Criterion 2 since it targets more than one Intentional Element.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model is complex and maintains clear relationships between the Intentional Elements, but it has multiple decompositions that could potentially complicate the understanding of the actor's obligations.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Validity**:
   - The model decomposes `IE2` into `IE_A` (an instruction of the individual) and `IE_AND_B_OR`. However, `IE_AND_B_OR` is a combination of Precondition elements which are further decomposed into `IE_B` and `IE_C`. This follows Criterion 1 since all elements involved are Precondition types.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of `IE2` targets more than one Intentional Element (`IE_A` and `IE_AND_B_OR`), satisfying Criterion 2.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The model is structured logically, with clear paths of dependencies and decompositions. It also appropriately breaks down the complex precondition into simpler components.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Validity**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, `IE2` is decomposed into `P_A` and `P_AND_B_C`, maintaining the Precondition modality. The subsequent decomposition of `P_AND_B_C` into `P_B` and `P_C` is also valid according to Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition targets more than one Intentional Element (`P_A` and `P_AND_B_C`), thus fulfilling Criterion 2.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - This model also maintains a clear and logical structure, providing a straightforward breakdown of the precondition and its associated elements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that both Choice 2 and Choice 3 effectively meet the criteria with clear and valid decompositions. However, Choice 2 introduces a more complex structure with an additional logical layer (`IE_AND_B_OR`) that could lead to confusion, while Choice 3 maintains simplicity without losing clarity.

Thus, considering the criteria and the need for a clear model that adheres to the outlined rules, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - **Intentional Elements**: The model has both «Obligation» and «Precondition» intentional elements.
   - **Criterion 1 Violation**: There is a decomposition of IE2 (a Precondition) into IE3 (another Precondition) and IE4 (a Precondition), which is acceptable. However, there is also a decomposition from IE4 (a Precondition) into IE5 and IE6 (both Preconditions), and this is an OR decomposition, which is not clearly stated as allowed based on the criteria. Furthermore, there are also intentional elements of different modalities (Obligation and Precondition) linked via dependencies.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - **Criterion 2 Violation**: There are decompositions that satisfy the requirement of having more than one target intentional element. However, since the intentional elements are of different modalities, it raises a concern.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - **Intentional Elements**: It also contains both «Obligation» and «Precondition» intentional elements.
   - **Criterion 1 Violation**: Similar to Choice 1, the presence of both modalities in the same actor's intentional elements violates the requirement that decompositions should be between elements of the same type and modality.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - **Criterion 2 Violation**: There are also decompositions that target more than one intentional element. However, the existence of different modality intentional elements raises a concern.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - **Intentional Elements**: It maintains a clear distinction between «Obligation» and «Precondition» elements.
   - **Criterion 1 Compliance**: The decomposition of IE2 into sub-elements (P_A and P_AND_B_C) is a good practice, and they maintain the modality of Precondition.
  
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The decomposition of P_AND_B_C into P_B and P_C is valid since it targets more than one intentional element, both being Preconditions.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices based on the provided criteria, Choice 3 is the only one that adheres to both criteria without any violations. It maintains a clear separation of intentional elements based on modality and fulfills the requirement for decomposition.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition of Intentional Elements**:
   - The model decomposes a Precondition (IE2) into other Precondition elements (IE3, IE4, IE5, IE6) and an Obligation element (IE7). This violates **Criterion 1**, which states that decomposition must be between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. Here, IE2 (Precondition) is decomposed into elements of different modalities (Obligation and Precondition).
   
2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of IE2 into IE3 and IE4 does meet **Criterion 2** since it targets more than one Intentional Element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition of Intentional Elements**:
   - This choice effectively decomposes the Precondition (IE2) into sub-elements (IE_A, IE_AND_B_OR). However, the structure is still flawed because it tries to connect the components in a way that does not respect the intentional element modality strictly. The precondition should not create an obligation from its decomposition. Thus, it violates **Criterion 1**.
   
2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition does target more than one element (IE_A and IE_AND_B_OR), satisfying **Criterion 2**.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition of Intentional Elements**:
   - Choice 3 correctly identifies the Precondition (IE2) and decomposes it into sub-elements (P_A and P_AND_B_C) which are both of the same modality (Precondition). Hence, it satisfies **Criterion 1**.
   
2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition into P_A and P_AND_B_C satisfies **Criterion 2** as it targets more than one Intentional Element.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analyses, Choice 1 fails due to violating Criterion 1 with mixed modalities in decompositions. Choice 2 also fails for similar reasons despite targeting multiple elements. Choice 3 stands out as it adheres to both criteria, providing a clean decomposition without violating the modality rules.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To determine the best choice among the three provided options for modeling the legal statement into a GRL model, we will analyze each choice according to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model follows Criterion 1, as it decomposes the precondition (IE2) into other preconditions (IE3, IE4, etc.), and does not mix modalities.
   - However, the decomposition from IE2 to multiple preconditions (IE3, IE4, IE5, IE6) is valid as it has more than one target, satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Intentional Elements**: 
   - The model includes multiple intentional elements, which allows for a clear representation of the relationships and dependencies.
   - The decomposition from IE2 to IE3 and IE4 (AND) and from IE4 to IE5 and IE6 (OR) is appropriate.

3. **Linkages**: 
   - The dependencies and decompositions create a complex structure that accurately reflects the legal obligations and conditions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The model follows Criterion 1, as it decomposes the precondition (IE2) into multiple intentional elements while maintaining modality consistency.
   - The decomposition into sub-elements is clear, but it does not provide as rich a breakdown as Choice 1.

2. **Intentional Elements**: 
   - This model creates several sub intentional elements but lacks the depth that Choice 1 provides.
   - The connection between elements via contributions is correct, but it may not capture all nuances of the legal requirements.

3. **Linkages**: 
   - While there are dependencies and decompositions, the overall structure does not seem as comprehensive as Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This choice also adheres to Criterion 1, as it maintains modality consistency in its decompositions.
   - It does provide a breakdown of the precondition into its components effectively, following Criterion 2.

2. **Intentional Elements**: 
   - This model has a reasonable structure, but it appears somewhat redundant compared to Choice 1.
   - The additional intentional elements it introduces, while useful, do not enhance the clarity or usability of the model significantly compared to Choice 1.

3. **Linkages**: 
   - The dependencies and contributions are correctly established, but again, it lacks the depth and interconnectedness of Choice 1.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing each choice with a focus on the decomposition of intentional elements, clarity, and adherence to the specified criteria, it is clear that Choice 1 provides the most comprehensive, detailed, and clear model for the legal statement. It adheres strictly to the criteria and allows for a better understanding of the legal obligations and conditions.

**The best choice is 1.**

### Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article:  
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

### Classify and Format Atomic Legal Statements:  
Actor: HIC  
Modal Verb: shall  
Modality: Obligation  
Action(s): notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure  
Precondition(s): an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

### Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL:  
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "HIC"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE1"
                description: "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement: 
                id: "IE2"
                description: "an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = EL:
        Dependency: 
            source: IE2
            target: IE1

### Refine Legal GRL model:  
To refine the existing Legal GRL model, we will analyze the precondition and obligation in propositional logic, build the syntax tree, create sub IntentionalElements, and establish appropriate Decompositions and Contributions.

1. **Precondition Analysis**:
   - Propositional Logic Formula:
     - P: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   - Breakdown:
     - A: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a).
     - B: the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI.
     - C: the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
  
   - Formula: A and (B and C)

2. **Syntax Tree**:
       AND
       /         A    AND
            /             B  C

3. **Sub IntentionalElements**:
   - P_A: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a).
   - P_B: the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI.
   - P_C: the custodian considers the PHI reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - P_AND_B_C: an instruction of the individual made under clause (1)(a) and the custodian prevents the disclosure of all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.

4. **Decompositions**:
   - `IE2` decomposes into `P_A` and `P_AND_B_C` with an 'AND' Decomposition.
   - `P_AND_B_C` decomposes into `P_B` and `P_C` with an 'AND' Decomposition.

5. **Contribution Links**:
   - Contribution from `P_A` to `IE2` with level 100 (satisfaction of P_A ensures satisfaction of IE2).
