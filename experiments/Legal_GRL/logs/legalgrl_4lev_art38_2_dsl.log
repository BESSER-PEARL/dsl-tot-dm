Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

Choice 1:
Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. 
   - Precondition: If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the established criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.**
   - **Precondition:** If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.
   
   - **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.**
   - **Precondition:** If the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:** 
- The first statement captures the action of disclosing PHI but does not clearly connect the two actions (disclosure and notification) in a structured way that highlights their relationship.
- The preconditions are explicitly stated and correctly extracted.
- However, splitting the actions into two separate statements may lead to confusion regarding their interdependence.

### Choice 2:
1. **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.**

**Analysis:**
- This choice combines the notification requirement into a single statement, maintaining clarity.
- However, it does not explicitly mention the act of disclosing PHI, which is crucial for understanding the context of the notification.
- The precondition is correctly identified but seems to be overly complex due to the merging of actions.

### Choice 3:
1. **HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.**

**Analysis:**
- This choice effectively combines both the disclosure of PHI and the notification requirement into one statement, linking them in a clear manner.
- It incorporates all the necessary conditions for the notification to occur, thus fulfilling the criteria of atomic statements from the perspective of HIC while also addressing the preconditions effectively.
- The complexity is managed better than in Choice 2, as it retains the connection between actions.

### Conclusion:
Given the analyses, Choice 3 is the most comprehensive and clear representation of the legal requirements from the perspective of HIC. It effectively captures the atomic statements and preconditions while maintaining the necessary connections between actions.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Statements:**
  1. "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual."
  2. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
- **Preconditions:**
  - The first atomic statement includes a precondition based on the individualâ€™s instruction.
  - The second atomic statement also correctly identifies a condition that must be met (the instruction of the individual) before the notification occurs.

**Analysis:**
Choice 1 successfully extracts two atomic statements from the law article, clearly outlining the actions that HIC must take. Additionally, it properly identifies preconditions for both actions, ensuring that the perspective of the focal actor (HIC) is adequately represented.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Statement:**
  1. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

**Analysis:**
Choice 2 combines the action of notifying with the precondition into a single atomic statement. While it captures the necessary condition for the notification, it fails to fully reflect the requirement for HIC to disclose PHI as a separate action. This is a significant oversight since it does not allow for the independent analysis of actions that HIC must undertake.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Statement:**
  1. "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

**Analysis:**
Choice 3 tries to combine both actions into one atomic statement but becomes overly complex and convoluted. It introduces additional conditions that are not necessary for the notification action itself. While it captures the dependencies, it obscures the clarity of the actions HIC must undertake. This makes it less effective for generating clear legal models.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the clarity of atomic statements and the appropriate identification of preconditions, **Choice 1** stands out as the best option. It maintains distinct actions for HIC while ensuring that preconditions are clearly articulated.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Statement 1: "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual."
     - **Precondition:** "If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Statement 2: "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
     - **Precondition:** Same as above.

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** The first statement about the disclosure of PHI is accurate, but it lacks specificity regarding the conditional nature based on the precondition. The second statement accurately identifies the notification requirement, but the precondition is not clearly tied to the act of notifying.
- **Criterion 2:** The preconditions are extracted, but they are somewhat repetitive and not clearly linked to the actions they are meant to condition.

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** This choice combines the notification obligation with the condition into a single atomic statement. It captures the essence of the requirement but loses clarity on the disclosure of PHI which is a separate obligation.
- **Criterion 2:** The precondition is embedded in the statement, which makes it clear but less flexible for modeling separate actions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."

#### Analysis:
- **Criterion 1:** This statement captures both the notification and the conditions for that notification. However, it combines two separate conditions into a single atomic statement, which may reduce clarity and makes it more complex.
- **Criterion 2:** The preconditions are clearly laid out, but they are also combined in a way that could make it harder to discern separate obligations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices based on the criteria:

- **Choice 1** provides separate statements but has repetitive preconditions.
- **Choice 2** combines the notification and the precondition effectively but obscures the separate act of disclosing PHI.
- **Choice 3** combines too many elements into one statement, which could lead to confusion.

Given that clarity and separation of actions are important for legal modeling, **Choice 1** emerges as the best option, as it maintains separate statements and conditions, albeit with some redundancy.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria for extracting atomic legal statements and preconditions from the law article.

**Choice 1:**
1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. 
   - Precondition: If the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
   - Precondition: If the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- The first statement correctly identifies an action by HIC regarding the disclosure of PHI, which meets Criterion 1. 
- The precondition for both statements is derived correctly, addressing the "if" clauses in the law article, which aligns with Criterion 2.
- This choice clearly separates the actions and their respective preconditions, providing clarity.

**Choice 2:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- This choice combines the notification requirement and its precondition into a single statement. 
- While the precondition is correctly identified, this choice does not separate the actions clearly, which can lead to confusion in understanding the different responsibilities of HIC. 
- It may partially fulfill Criterion 1, but it does not fully adhere to the clarity expected in legal models.

**Choice 3:**
1. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

**Analysis:**
- This choice includes multiple conditions in a single statement, making it more complex and harder to parse.
- Although it identifies the notification requirement, the combination of multiple "if" clauses complicates understanding the conditions under which actions take place.
- This structure does not effectively meet Criterion 1 due to its lack of clarity, and it does not facilitate easy extraction of atomic statements.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing all the choices against the criteria, Choice 1 stands out as it maintains clarity by separating actions and their preconditions, ensuring compliance with both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the stated criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual." 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure."
   
   Both statements are clear atomic actions related to the HIC. 

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The precondition for the first statement is well-defined and captures the condition under which the HIC discloses PHI.
   - The precondition for the second statement correctly identifies that the notification is contingent upon the individualâ€™s instruction preventing the custodian from disclosing necessary PHI.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statement**: 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of PHI if an instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   
   This statement combines the action and its precondition into one, which is less clear as it conflates two distinct actions (notification and the condition under which it occurs) into a single statement.

2. **Precondition**:
   - The precondition is embedded within the atomic statement, but it lacks clarity. It does not separate the actions of disclosing and notifying, thus making it harder to analyze the individual responsibilities of the HIC.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statement**: 
   - "HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure if an HIC discloses PHI about an individual and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   
   This statement is overly complex as it combines multiple conditions into one. It makes it difficult to extract distinct actions or responsibilities for the HIC.

2. **Precondition**:
   - The precondition is convoluted and includes multiple "if" clauses, which may confuse the clarity needed in legal statements.

### Conclusion:
Choice 1 stands out as it effectively separates distinct atomic actions and clearly articulates preconditions without merging them into a single, complex statement. This alignment with the criteria ensures clarity and precision necessary for legal modeling.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)
  
- **Analysis:**
  - The first statement includes a precondition related to the instructions of the individual, violating Criterion 1.
  - The second statement also includes a precondition, which again violates Criterion 1.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)

- **Analysis:**
  - Both statements include preconditions explicitly, violating Criterion 1.
  - While the classification of both statements is correct as obligations, the presence of preconditions is a critical issue.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual. (Obligation)
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure. (Obligation)
  
- **Analysis:**
  - Like the previous choices, this one also includes preconditions connected to both atomic statements, violating Criterion 1.
  - The classification as obligations remains accurate, but the preconditions are a significant problem.

**Conclusion:**
All choices violate Criterion 1 as they include preconditions in the description of actions. However, since all choices are structured similarly in terms of obligations, there is no distinct "best" choice based on the provided criteria. That said, all choices fail to meet at least one of the criteria, meaning they do not fulfill the requirements for generating legal GRL models effectively.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 by including descriptions of preconditions in the actions, which disqualifies them from being suitable models for generating a legal GRL model. Therefore, despite the continuous violations, I must conclude that none of the choices meet the criteria adequately. 

However, if I have to select the least objectionable choice based on the clearer separation of legal statements, I would choose:

   - The classification of both as obligations is consistent.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
1. **Criterion 1:** Violates this criterion as both actions include descriptions of preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2:** Correctly classifies both statements as obligations.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1, as they include preconditions in the action descriptions. However, they correctly classify the legal statements as obligations in accordance with Criterion 2. Since all three choices are similarly flawed regarding Criterion 1, the evaluation does not lead to a distinct preference based on the criteria provided.

Therefore, the best choice is **1**.

 **Analysis of Choices:**

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations which is correct.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - The choice fails because it explicitly includes preconditions in the description of actions. This violates Criterion 1.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified correctly as obligations.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - This choice also includes preconditions in the statements, failing Criterion 1.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is correct.
  
- **Preconditions:**
  - Similar to the previous choices, this choice also includes preconditions in the description of actions, violating Criterion 1.

---

**Conclusion:**
All three choices have the same issues regarding the inclusion of preconditions in the action descriptions. Despite being classified correctly, none of the choices meet the criteria fully. However, they all reflect the obligations of HIC accurately. If I must choose the best among them based on minimal violations, I would select the choice with the least explicit emphasis on preconditions within the action descriptions.

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.
  
- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.
  
- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.

- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. HIC shall disclose PHI about an individual.
  2. HIC shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure.

- **Preconditions:** 
  - Each action includes a description of preconditions, violating Criterion 1.

- **Classification:**
  - Both statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate under Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
None of the choices fully comply with Criterion 1, as all include preconditions in the descriptions of actions. However, all choices correctly classify the actions as obligations under Criterion 2. Given that all choices are flawed in a similar manner, we need to select the one that at least correctly presents the actions without altering their meanings. 

Upon review, all choices present the same information with respect to obligations and preconditions, so they are equivalent in this context. However, since Choice 1 presents the information in a more compact format without separate precondition listings, it is slightly preferable.

The best choice is 1.

Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

Constraint 1: A Â«PreconditionÂ», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be Â«PreconditionÂ», and the source of a Dependency must be either an Â«ObligationÂ» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an Â«PermissionÂ» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one Â«GoalÂ», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the Â«GoalÂ» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the Â«GoalÂ» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one Â«PreconditionÂ», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the Â«PreconditionÂ» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the Â«PreconditionÂ» created in step 3 to the Â«GoalÂ» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the Â«PreconditionÂ» is the source.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is correct with two obligations (disclosing PHI and notifying the person).
- **Classification**: 
  - The first statement is classified as an obligation with a corresponding precondition (IE3).
  - The second statement is also classified correctly with its precondition (IE4).
- **Model Elements**: 
  - There are some redundancies since IE3 and IE4 both describe preconditions that are essentially the same but phrased differently. This is a duplication issue.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Dependencies are established correctly as per the criteria, with both dependencies originating from preconditions.

**Conclusion for Choice 1**: While it meets most criteria, the duplication of preconditions (IE3 and IE4) is a significant flaw.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is accurate and maintains the core obligations.
- **Classification**: 
  - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations are linked to their respective preconditions. 
- **Model Elements**: 
  - The same issue exists with IE3 and IE4 being almost identical in content, indicating duplication.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - The dependencies are correctly established where preconditions lead to the obligations.

**Conclusion for Choice 2**: Again, despite meeting other criteria, the duplication of model elements (IE3 and IE4) is problematic.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

- **Extraction of Atomic Legal Statements**: This choice modifies the original statements to include "if" conditions directly in the obligation phrasing.
- **Classification**: 
  - The obligations are correctly classified, and the preconditions are logically linked.
- **Model Elements**: 
  - However, the precondition for the first obligation is an alteration of the original statement. This implies a misinterpretation of the law as it changes the essence of the requirement, hence it can't be considered an accurate representation.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Dependencies are well established, but the changes to the obligations could lead to misrepresentations of the legal requirements.

**Conclusion for Choice 3**: While it avoids duplication, it misrepresents legal obligations, which is a critical flaw.

### Final Conclusion:
After careful analysis of each choice against the established criteria, **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** both have issues with duplication, while **Choice 3** misinterprets the legal obligations. However, since **Choice 1** and **Choice 2** maintain the integrity of the legal statements better than **Choice 3**, I conclude that the best choice, despite its duplication flaw, is:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - IE3 (Precondition) is correctly linked to IE1 (Obligation to disclose PHI) and IE4 (Precondition) to IE2 (Obligation to notify). This satisfies Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.
   
2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - IE3 and IE4 have identical descriptions, which violates Criterion 3, as there is duplication in the model elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, IE3 links to IE1 and IE4 links to IE2. This also satisfies both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - Again, IE3 and IE4 have identical descriptions, leading to duplication. This violates Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**:
   - This choice links IE3 (Precondition about the absence of an instruction) to IE1 (Obligation to disclose PHI) and IE4 (Precondition about the presence of an instruction) to IE2 (Obligation to notify). This satisfies Criterion 1 and Criterion 2.

2. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - IE3 and IE4 have different descriptions from each other, thus there is no duplication. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- Choice 1 and Choice 2 fail due to the duplication of model elements.
- Choice 3 successfully adheres to all the criteria without duplication.

Therefore, "The best choice is 3".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The two obligations and their preconditions are correctly extracted.
2. **Modeling**:
   - The model includes intentional elements of type Goal for both obligations and both preconditions.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - IE3 and IE4 are both defined as Goals with modality Precondition.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - There are dependencies established from the preconditions to the obligations.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - There is duplication of precondition descriptions (IE3 and IE4 describe similar conditions with slightly different wording).
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met (both preconditions define goals).
   - **Criterion 2**: Met (dependencies from preconditions to obligations).
   - **Criterion 3**: Not met (duplication of model elements).

### Choice 2:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The extraction is identical to Choice 1.
2. **Modeling**:
   - The model structure is similar to Choice 1.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - Again, both preconditions are modeled as separate goals.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - The dependencies are correctly established.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there is duplication with IE3 and IE4.
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met.
   - **Criterion 2**: Met.
   - **Criterion 3**: Not met (duplication).

### Choice 3:
1. **Extract Atomic Legal Statements**: The obligations are rephrased with conditions included; thus, it follows a different format.
2. **Modeling**:
   - There are still two obligations modeled as Goals.
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - The preconditions are incorporated into the obligation descriptions.
   - **Dependencies**: 
     - Dependencies are established correctly with clear distinctions.
3. **Duplication**: 
   - There is no duplication of descriptions since the preconditions have been integrated directly into the obligations, making the model more concise.
4. **Criterion Evaluation**: 
   - **Criterion 1**: Met (preconditions are implied in the obligations).
   - **Criterion 2**: Met (dependencies are correctly defined).
   - **Criterion 3**: Met (no duplication).

### Conclusion:
Choice 3 effectively captures the legal statements while adhering to the criteria without duplication. The obligations and their conditions are clearly defined without redundancy.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 ("If the individual has made an instruction...") is a Precondition and is the source of a Dependency pointing to IE1 ("disclose PHI about an individual"). This meets Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source of the first Dependency is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE1 (Obligation). The source of the second Dependency is IE4 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - The model includes two different preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with similar descriptions, which could lead to confusion. Thus, this choice does not fully meet Criterion 3 due to the potential for redundancy in the descriptions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 is a Precondition and is the source of a Dependency pointing to IE1. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The source of the first Dependency is IE3 (Precondition) and the target is IE1 (Obligation). The source of the second Dependency is IE4 (Precondition) and the target is IE2 (Obligation). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are two distinct preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with overlapping descriptions. This means that Criterion 3 is not fully met due to potential duplication in the model.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition as Source**: 
   - IE3 ("The individual has not made an instruction...") is a Precondition and serves as a source for a Dependency pointing to IE1. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The first Dependency has IE3 (Precondition) as the source and IE1 (Obligation) as the target. The second Dependency has IE4 (Precondition) as the source and IE2 (Obligation) as the target. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication Check**: 
   - The descriptions of the preconditions are modified to clarify their meaning. However, they still present similar content concerning the conditions under which obligations are triggered. This could lead to confusion and may not fully satisfy Criterion 3, as they describe closely related concepts.

### Conclusion
All choices meet the first two criteria regarding the structure of dependencies and preconditions. However, Choices 1 and 2 suffer from redundancy issues related to their preconditions, while Choice 3 slightly modifies the descriptions but may still lead to confusion. Despite this, the clearer distinctions in Choice 3 make it the most effective in communicating the obligations and their dependencies.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the given criteria, let's analyze each option step-by-step.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - IE3 and IE4 are both preconditions, and they serve as the source for dependencies in this model (IE3 links to IE1 and IE4 links to IE2). This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies correctly link preconditions (IE3, IE4) to obligations (IE1, IE2). This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - There are two preconditions (IE3 and IE4) that have very similar descriptions. This violates Criterion 3 as they essentially convey the same information.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - Like Choice 1, IE3 and IE4 are preconditions that serve as the source of dependencies. This satisfies Criterion 1.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies are correctly established with preconditions targeting obligations. This satisfies Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are two preconditions (IE3 and IE4) with similar descriptions, which violates Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Dependency**: 
   - The model defines a precondition (IE3) and links it to the obligation (IE1). However, the precondition for the first obligation is incorrectly stated as it implies a negation (if the individual has not made an instruction), which alters the meaning of the original law article. This violates Criterion 1 because the precondition should be the exact condition under which the obligation applies.
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: 
   - The dependencies are established, but due to the incorrect precondition in IE3, this does not accurately reflect the law article, violating Criterion 2.
   
3. **Duplication of Elements**: 
   - There are two distinct preconditions, which do not duplicate in description. This satisfies Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
Both Choices 1 and 2 meet the precondition and dependency criteria but have issues with duplicative elements. Choice 3 fails to correctly reflect the original law article's intent in its preconditions, which is critical for the accurate generation of Legal GRL models. 

Given these analyses, the best choice is **2** because it captures the obligations and their dependencies without altering the intent of the law article while also ensuring that the elements are distinct.

The best choice is 2.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) If an HIC discloses PHI about an individual under clause (1) (a) and if an instruction of the individual made under that clause prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual, the custodian shall notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure of that fact.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine Â«ObligationsÂ», Â«PermissionsÂ» and Â«PreconditionsÂ» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

â€” begin of Legal GRL Syntax â€”

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'
    'id:' id=ID
    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?
;

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

EL: Contribution | Decomposition | Dependency;

Contribution: 'Contribution:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
    'level:' level=INT

Decomposition: 'Decomposition:'
    'source:' source=[IE]

    'decompositionType:' decompositionType=decompositionType
;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A Â«PreconditionÂ», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be Â«PreconditionÂ», and the source of a Dependency must be either an Â«ObligationÂ» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an Â«PermissionÂ» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

â€” end of Legal GRL Syntax â€”

Refinement steps:
(1) For each Â«PreconditionÂ» or each Â«ObligationsÂ» or each Â«PermissionsÂ», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a Â«PreconditionÂ» as the running example. The instructions apply to Â«ObligationsÂ» and Â«PermissionsÂ» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the Â«PreconditionÂ» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub Â«PreconditionsÂ» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all Â«PreconditionsÂ», not Â«ObligationsÂ» nor Â«PermissionsÂ», because in the example, we are decomposing a Â«PreconditionÂ» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: Â«PreconditionÂ» P is decomposed into Â«PreconditionÂ» P_A and Â«PreconditionÂ» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: Â«PreconditionÂ» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into Â«PreconditionÂ» P_B and Â«PreconditionÂ» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: Â«PreconditionÂ» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into Â«PreconditionÂ» P_C and Â«PreconditionÂ» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model: 
#### Step 1: Propositional Logic Formulas
1. For the obligation to disclose PHI:
   - Proposition A: The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: A
2. For the obligation to notify:
   - Proposition B: The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: B

#### Step 2: Syntax Trees
1. Syntax tree for obligation to disclose:
```
       A
```
2. Syntax tree for obligation to notify:
```
       B
```

#### Step 3: Creating Sub IntentionalElements 
- For both obligations, we have:
  - For IE3 (disclosure):
    - P_A: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."
  - For IE4 (notification):
    - P_B: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."

#### Step 4: Decompositions
```
Decomposition for IE1 (disclose PHI):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE3 with AND
Decomposition for IE2 (notify):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE4 with AND
```


### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

### Refine Legal GRL model:
Following the refinement steps:

1. **Propositional Logic Formulation:**
   - For IE3: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Propositional formula: \( \neg A \) (where \( A \) = "the individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian...")

   - For IE4: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
   - Propositional formula: \( A \) (where \( A \) = "the instruction of the individual prevents the custodian...")

2. **Syntax Tree Construction:**
   - For IE3: The logic can be expressed as \( \neg A \).
   - For IE4: The logic remains \( A \).

3. **Sub Intentional Elements Creation:**
   - For IE3:
     - IE3.1: "The individual has made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI."
     - IE3.2: "The custodian considers reasonable PHI necessary for health care provision."
   - For IE4:
     - IE4.1: "The instruction prevents disclosure of necessary PHI."

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each proposed choice based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - The decomposition is correctly done between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. Obligation (IE1 and IE2) is decomposed into Preconditions (IE3 and IE4) appropriately.
   - However, the decomposition from IE1 to IE3 and from IE2 to IE4 needs to comply with the criterion that the target of the decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element. In this case, each obligation is decomposed into one precondition, which does not satisfy Criterion 2.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - While it successfully classifies and formats the legal statements, the decomposition does not meet Criterion 2 since it fails to have multiple targets for each obligation. 

### Choice 2
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - This choice similarly presents the obligations from HIC and their respective preconditions. However, it does not include any decomposition for Obligations into multiple Preconditions, which again violates Criterion 2.
   - The model appears to show the correct relationships but lacks the necessary breakdown required by the criteria.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - As with Choice 1, this choice fails to meet Criterion 2, as it does not decompose each obligation into more than one intentional element.

### Choice 3
1. **Decomposition Validity**: 
   - The model is structured similarly to the previous choices and tries to capture the essence of the obligations. However, it also fails to satisfy Criterion 2 because it does not decompose each obligation into multiple intentional elements.
   - The model retains the definitions of obligations and preconditions, but the lack of multiple decomposition targets for each obligation means it does not fully meet the requirements.

2. **Overall Conclusion**: 
   - This choice also fails to meet Criterion 2, as it doesnâ€™t present more than one Intentional Element as a target for each obligation.

### Final Assessment
Given that all three choices fail to satisfy the critical Criterion 2, they all have significant shortcomings. However, Choice 1 and Choice 2 at least attempt to maintain a clearer separation of elements and relationships compared to Choice 3, which introduces additional elements without addressing the core decompositions.

Based on the analyses:
- Choice 1 has the most structured approach, despite its failure regarding the decomposition criteria.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 ### Analysis of Choices

#### **Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - The decomposition adheres to Criterion 1, as all decomposed intentional elements belong to the same modality (Obligation and Precondition).
   - However, Criterion 2 is not fully satisfied. The decomposition links are only linking one precondition to one obligation. This violates the criterion that states the target of decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The structure of the model is clear, with a good representation of actors and intentional elements. The contributions and dependencies are also clearly laid out.

#### **Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - It meets Criterion 1 as it correctly decomposes obligations into their respective preconditions.
   - Criterion 2 is partially addressed. While the preconditions are linked to the obligations, the decomposition doesn't involve multiple intentional elements in the target, which is a requirement.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The model is well-organized, and it maintains clarity in representing obligations and their preconditions. The contributions are also appropriately established.

#### **Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Decomposition Criteria:**
   - Criterion 1 is adhered to, as it maintains proper decomposition of obligations and preconditions.
   - Criterion 2 is not satisfied. The model includes decompositions targeting single elements instead of multiple elements, which violates the requirement for more than one Intentional Element.

2. **Structure and Clarity:**
   - The structure is a bit more complex due to the addition of multiple sub-intentional elements, which adds clarity regarding the relationships but may complicate the understanding of links and contributions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the three choices based on the specified criteria, it is evident that all choices have strengths and weaknesses, primarily regarding the adherence to Criterion 2. However, **Choice 2** stands out as the most structured and clear model, even though it does not fully satisfy Criterion 2. It maintains a good balance between clarity and the correct application of decomposition rules.

The best choice is **2**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the given criteria and the domain description:

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - The decomposition in the model only involves intentional elements of the same type and modality. The obligations (IE1 and IE2) are decomposed based on preconditions (IE3 and IE4), which fit the requirement.
   - Each obligation (IE1 and IE2) is linked to a specific precondition, adhering to the guideline of having more than one intentional element (in a sense that they rely on conditions for their fulfillment).

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The decompositions are straightforward, with each obligation linked to a single precondition. However, there are no instances where an obligation is decomposed into multiple preconditions, which could have strengthened the model further.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, this model adheres to the decomposition rules where obligations are linked to preconditions (IE3 and IE4).
   - However, it introduces additional elements (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D) which complicate the structure. Here, preconditions are further decomposed into two sub-intentional elements, but these do not necessarily provide additional clarity or utility.

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The model attempts to create multiple targets for decomposition but introduces complexity without necessarily improving the clarity of the model. 

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criteria**:
   - This model follows the same rules of decomposition as the previous choices. Each obligation is linked to a precondition.
   - While it introduces further sub-intentional elements, the actual precondition to obligation link remains intact, which maintains the model's integrity.

2. **Multiple Targets for Decomposition**:
   - The model attempts to break down the preconditions into more granular elements. However, it introduces a logical structure that may confuse rather than clarify the relationships between obligations and their conditions.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices based on the stated criteria, it is clear that:

- **Choice 1** maintains the simplest and clearest structure that adheres strictly to the decomposition rules without unnecessary complexity. 
- **Choice 2** and **Choice 3** introduce additional elements and decompositions that do not significantly enhance understanding and may complicate the model.

Thus, "The best choice is 1".
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - The decomposition is between intentional elements of the same type and modality. 
   - IE1 (disclose PHI) is decomposed into IE3 (precondition), which is valid since both are obligations.
   - IE2 (notify) is decomposed into IE4 (precondition), which is also valid for the same reason.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - Both decompositions are to single intentional elements (IE3 and IE4).
   - **Result:** Does not meet Criterion 2 since the target of decomposition must be more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition involves appropriate intentional elements.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - Like Choice 1, the decompositions target single intentional elements (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D).
   - **Result:** Does not meet Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1: Decomposition**
   - The decomposition is again between intentional elements of the same type and modality.
   - **Result:** Meets Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2: Target of the Decomposition**
   - The decomposition for IE3 targets two sub-intentional elements (IE3.1 and IE3.2), and for IE4 targets one (IE4.1).
   - While IE3 meets the requirement, IE4 does not meet the requirement of more than one intentional element.
   - **Result:** Partially meets Criterion 2.

### Conclusion

All choices have shortcomings concerning Criterion 2, specifically regarding the requirement that the target of the decomposition must be more than one intentional element. However, Choice 3 provides the most comprehensive structure and attempts to meet the criteria of both decomposition and the number of elements in the decomposition.

Thus, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model decomposes the obligations (IE1 and IE2) into their respective preconditions (IE3 and IE4). This is consistent with Criterion 1, as each obligation is decomposed into preconditions.
2. **Multiple Targets**: Both decompositions target more than one intentional element, fulfilling Criterion 2. However, it only allows decomposition into one precondition per obligation, which may limit clarity in complex legal frameworks.
3. **Clarity and Structure**: The structure is clear, but the lack of further decomposition of preconditions into more granular elements may hinder deeper analysis and understanding.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: This choice attempts to break down the preconditions further into sub-intentional elements (P_A, P_B, etc.), which aligns with Criterion 1 as it maintains the same type and modality for each decomposition.
2. **Multiple Targets**: The decompositions here target more than one intentional element for each obligation (IE3 and IE4), satisfying Criterion 2 effectively.
3. **Complexity and Detail**: This choice provides a richer model by offering sub-intentional elements, enhancing clarity and depth. It covers the necessary details without losing sight of the obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: While Choice 3 begins with a strong structure, it seems to simplify its preconditions back to a level that does not fully utilize the potential of decomposition into several intentional elements. This approach doesn't align as well with Criterion 1, as it does not clearly distinguish between different types of instructions and their effects.
2. **Multiple Targets**: Some decompositions target multiple elements, but they might be less informative compared to the more detailed approach in Choice 2.
3. **Overall Clarity**: This choice is less structured in terms of the relationships between elements, leading to potential confusion regarding how the obligations interact with the preconditions.

### Conclusion:
Considering the analysis of all three choices, Choice 2 stands out due to its adherence to both criteria, offering a well-structured, detailed, and clear representation of the legal obligations and their associated preconditions. It effectively manages the complexity of the legal framework while ensuring compliance with the decomposition criteria.

The best choice is **2**.

### Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "HIC"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE1"
                description: "disclose PHI about an individual"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE2"
                description: "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE4"
                description: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual."
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = EL:
        Dependency:
            source: IE3
            target: IE1
        Dependency:
            source: IE4
            target: IE2
;
```

### Refine Legal GRL model: 
#### Step 1: Propositional Logic Formulas
1. For the obligation to disclose PHI:
   - Proposition A: The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: A
2. For the obligation to notify:
   - Proposition B: The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care.
   - Formula: B

#### Step 2: Syntax Trees
1. Syntax tree for obligation to disclose:
```
       A
```
2. Syntax tree for obligation to notify:
```
       B
```

#### Step 3: Creating Sub IntentionalElements 
- For both obligations, we have:
  - For IE3 (disclosure):
    - P_A: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."
  - For IE4 (notification):
    - P_B: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing PHI."

#### Step 4: Decompositions
```
Decomposition for IE1 (disclose PHI):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE3 with AND
Decomposition for IE2 (notify):
    - IE1 decomposes to IE4 with AND
```


### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:
```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "HIC"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE1"
                description: "disclose PHI about an individual"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE2"
                description: "notify the person to whom it makes the disclosure"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE3"
                description: "The individual has not made an instruction that prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care."
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            "IntentionalElement:"
                id: "IE4"
                description: "The instruction of the individual prevents the custodian from disclosing all the PHI that the custodian considers reasonably necessary to disclose for the provision of health care."
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
    elementLinks = EL:
        Decomposition:
            source: IE1
            target: IE3, IE4
            decompositionType: AND
        Dependency:
            source: IE3
            target: IE1
        Dependency:
            source: IE4
            target: IE2
;
``` 

This refined model clearly delineates the obligations and their respective preconditions, structured in accordance with the Legal GRL syntax.
