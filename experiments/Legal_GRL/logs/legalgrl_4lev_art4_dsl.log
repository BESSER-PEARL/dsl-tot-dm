Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

 Let's analyze each choice with regard to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements extracted clearly identify the obligations of **Member States** regarding **customers**.
   - Each statement is precise and reflects a different aspect of the directive, ensuring that the focal actors are highlighted.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - The extracted statements do not include any clauses that start with "if," which means that preconditions are not explicitly represented in this choice. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also effectively captures the obligations of **Member States** concerning **customers**.
   - The phrasing is slightly different but maintains clarity and specificity.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - Like Choice 1, there are no statements that incorporate clauses beginning with "if," leaving preconditions unaddressed.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - The statements in this choice also identify the obligations of **Member States** but use "must" instead of "shall ensure." This may imply a stronger obligation, which could be beneficial in legal interpretations.
   - However, it uses "customers" instead of "all customers," which could be considered less specific.

2. **Preconditions**:
   - This choice similarly lacks any "if" clauses, failing to demonstrate any preconditions that could be derived from the article.

### Conclusion:
All three choices successfully extract atomic statements from the law article, focusing on the perspectives of **Member States** and **customers**. However, none of the choices adequately address preconditions, as none of them include clauses that begin with "if."

Between the three, Choice 1 and Choice 2 are effectively the same in terms of content, while Choice 3 employs a slightly different wording that could be interpreted as more assertive. However, the use of "customers" instead of "all customers" in Choice 3 may reduce its specificity, making it less aligned with the directive's language.

Given that all choices fail to address preconditions and Choices 1 and 2 are essentially equivalent, I conclude that:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement captures the essence of the law article, focusing on both the Member States and the Customers. 
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - This is another correct representation of the article, again focusing on the relevant actors.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement correctly indicates a requirement that Member States need to fulfill, but it does not directly involve the Customers.

**Analysis**: All the statements are correctly extracted, and the focus on both Member States and Customers is appropriate. However, the last statement is more about the obligation of the Member States and does not directly address the Customers.

### Choice 2:
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This is a correct extraction, maintaining the focus on both Member States and Customers.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - This is also a precise representation that includes the necessary actors.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.
   - Similar to Choice 1, this statement reflects the obligation of Member States without a direct implication for Customers.

**Analysis**: The statements are correctly extracted. The focus is on the relevant actors, but, like Choice 1, the last statement is more administrative and does not directly involve the Customers.

### Choice 3:
1. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This is a valid extraction but uses "must" instead of "shall." The term "must" may imply a stronger obligation, but it does not change the meaning significantly. 

2. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - This statement is also valid and maintains the focus on Customers.

3. **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This is again a correct representation of the obligations of Member States.

**Analysis**: While the use of "must" may add a sense of urgency or obligation, it does not significantly change the atomic statements extracted. All statements accurately reflect the law article and appropriately involve both Member States and Customers.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all three choices based on the criteria, it appears that all choices successfully extract atomic statements from the law article. However, Choices 1 and 2 are nearly identical, and they both pay attention to the focal actors, but their last statements do not directly involve Customers. Choice 3 successfully maintains the focus on Customers while slightly changing the tone of obligation.

Nonetheless, all choices fulfill the requirements to some extent, but Choice 3 provides a slight edge in terms of clearly focusing on the Customers while still addressing the Member States' obligations.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice accurately extracts atomic statements from the law article, focusing on the perspective of Member States and customers. It captures the rights of customers effectively.
- **Criterion 2**: There are no conditional statements (clauses starting with "if") in this choice. However, it captures the necessary conditions for customers to exercise their rights.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice is identical to Choice 1, thus it also successfully extracts atomic statements and addresses the perspectives of Member States and customers.
- **Criterion 2**: Similar to Choice 1, it does not include any conditional clauses, but it does include the necessary conditions for customer rights.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**:
   - "Member States must ensure that customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - "Member States must ensure that customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - "Member States must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice modifies the language from "shall" to "must," which can imply a stronger obligation. It also uses "customers" without the qualifier "all," which may overlook any specificity regarding the customer base. However, it still reflects the perspective of the focal actors adequately.
- **Criterion 2**: Like the previous choices, it lacks any conditional clauses. It captures the obligations of Member States effectively.

### Conclusion:
All choices successfully extract atomic statements, but Choices 1 and 2 maintain the original phrasing of the law article and specify "all customers," which may be important for legal clarity and comprehensiveness. Choice 3 introduces a stronger obligation but loses specificity by omitting “all” in reference to customers.

Considering both criteria and the need for clarity in legal language, "The best choice is 1."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement accurately reflects the legal requirement and identifies both the focal actor (Member States) and the affected party (customers).
   
2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - Similar to the first statement, this captures the essence of the law and identifies the actors appropriately.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This statement is also clear and identifies the action that must be taken, relevant to the focal actors.

**Criterion 1** is satisfied as the atomic statements are derived correctly from the perspective of both Member States and customers. **Criterion 2** is also satisfied as it reflects the requirement for conditions that must be met.

---

**Choice 2:**
1. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - This statement is identical to the first statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria effectively.

2. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - Again, this is identical to the second statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria.

3. **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.
   - This is also identical to the third statement in Choice 1 and meets the criteria.

While this choice effectively captures the same statements and identifies the actors, it does not introduce any new variations or insights into the atomic statements. Thus, it does not enhance the analysis compared to Choice 1.

---

**Choice 3:**
1. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - This statement simplifies the description but loses the explicit mention of "all customers," which may not emphasize the legal scope adequately. It still captures the essence of the requirement.

2. **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - Similar to the first statement, this does not specify "all customers," which could lead to ambiguity.

3. **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - This statement remains clear but, again, lacks the emphasis on "all customers."

Although Choice 3 maintains a focus on the focal actors, it does not fully satisfy **Criterion 1** as it does not explicitly include "all customers," which is essential for the legal clarity required in GRL models. It also does not delineate any specific preconditions related to "if" clauses effectively.

### Conclusion
The best choice is 1, as it fully meets both criteria regarding the extraction of atomic statements and preconditions while clearly identifying the focal actors. 

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers** are **free** to **have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that the **required connection and metering points are established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively extracts atomic statements relevant to the focal actors, Member States and Customers. It clearly delineates the responsibilities of Member States and the rights granted to Customers.
- **Criterion 2**: It does not address preconditions, as it does not identify any clauses that begin with "if."

### Choice 2:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time**.
   - **Member States** shall **ensure** that **the required connection and metering points are established**.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice is nearly identical to Choice 1. It accurately captures the atomic statements from the perspective of Member States and Customers.
- **Criterion 2**: Similar to Choice 1, it fails to identify preconditions for clauses starting with "if."

### Choice 3:
1. **Extracted Statements**:
   - **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - **Member States** must ensure that **customers** are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - **Member States** must ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

**Analysis**:
- **Criterion 1**: This choice effectively captures the atomic statements but uses "must" instead of "shall." This might affect the legal interpretation but still conveys the same responsibilities of Member States.
- **Criterion 2**: Like the previous choices, it does not identify preconditions for clauses starting with "if."

### Conclusion:
While all choices effectively extract atomic legal statements relevant to Member States and Customers, none of the choices fulfill the second criterion regarding the extraction of preconditions. However, Choices 1 and 2 are identical in terms of content and accurately reflect the legal language of the directive. Both Choices 1 and 2 provide a clearer distinction of the responsibilities assigned to Member States and the rights of Customers without introducing the potential ambiguity of "must" as in Choice 3.

 To determine the best choice based on the given domain description and criteria, I will analyze each choice in detail.

### Analysis of Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: The action clearly states that Member States must ensure freedom of choice for customers regarding electricity suppliers.
  2. Obligation: The action states the freedom for customers to hold multiple contracts, again an obligation for Member States.
  3. Obligation: This statement mandates the establishment of necessary infrastructure.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: All actions are described without preconditions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

**Choice 2:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: Ensures freedom for customers to choose suppliers.
  2. Obligation: Ensures customers can have multiple contracts.
  3. Obligation: Mandates the establishment of connections and metering points.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: Actions are described without preconditions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

**Choice 3:**
- **Atomic Legal Statements:**
  1. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
  2. Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
  3. Member States shall ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.

- **Classification:**
  1. Obligation: Freedom of choice for customers.
  2. Obligation: Freedom to have multiple contracts.
  3. Obligation: Establishment of metering points is required.

- **Criterion Compliance:**
  - Criterion 1: No preconditions are included in the actions.
  - Criterion 2: All statements are classified as obligations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that they all satisfy both criteria. However, Choices 1 and 2 contain slightly different phrasing around "ensure" and "provide," which does not impact the legal implications. All choices maintain the requirement of obligations without preconditions.

Since all choices meet the criteria perfectly, I will select the first choice as the best due to its clarity and directness in stating obligations without introducing alternative terminology that could lead to ambiguity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Action(s):** The actions are described as ensuring that customers are free to purchase electricity and have multiple supply contracts. However, the third statement does not directly refer to an action of the Member States but rather a condition that must be met (establishing connection and metering points). This may imply a precondition that is not aligned with Criterion 1.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2. 

However, due to the wording of the third statement, it may not fully align with the requirement that actions should not include preconditions. 

### Choice 2:
1. **Action(s):** Similar to Choice 1, the actions are clearly stated. However, the use of "provide that" instead of "ensure that" does not change the essence of the obligations but does introduce a slightly different implication for the actions. The third statement still indicates a requirement that must be established, which could imply a precondition.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, satisfying Criterion 2. 

Again, the third statement's phrasing suggests a potential precondition that contradicts Criterion 1.

### Choice 3:
1. **Action(s):** The actions in this choice are described as ensuring that customers are free to purchase electricity and have multiple contracts. The third statement, "ensure that the required connection and metering points are established," also reflects a requirement; however, the structure maintains a focus on the obligations of the Member States without explicit mention of preconditions.

2. **Classification:** All statements are classified as obligations, meeting Criterion 2.

This choice maintains clarity in action description and aligns most closely with the stated criteria.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the three choices, Choice 3 best adheres to both criteria by clearly outlining obligations without including preconditions in the descriptions of actions. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail while adhering to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - The actions clearly describe what Member States are obliged to ensure for customers without mentioning any preconditions. This aligns with Criterion 1.
   - Each statement is classified correctly as an obligation, satisfying Criterion 2.

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification of actions and modalities is consistent and correctly captures the obligations imposed on Member States.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Similar to Choice 1, the actions describe what Member States must ensure without including preconditions, meeting Criterion 1.
   - However, the use of "provide that" instead of "ensure" could introduce ambiguity regarding the nature of the obligation, as "provide" might imply a different form of responsibility. 

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification remains consistent, and all actions are classified as obligations, which meets Criterion 2. Despite this, the alteration in wording could be seen as a negative aspect.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements:**
   - Like the previous choices, the actions clearly articulate the obligations without preconditions, fulfilling Criterion 1.
   - The statements maintain clarity and adhere to the original language of the article, which is a positive aspect.

2. **Classification:**
   - The classification is consistent and accurately reflects the obligations of the Member States, satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the choices, both Choice 1 and Choice 3 comply with the criteria effectively, with clear actions and appropriate classifications. Choice 2, while mostly compliant, introduces potentially ambiguous wording that could detract from clarity. 

Thus, the best choice is 3, as it maintains the original language and clarity of obligations without introducing any ambiguity. 

The best choice is 3.

- **Criterion 1:** The choice does not include preconditions in the description of actions, which is compliant.
- **Criterion 2:** All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations. 

### Choice 3:
1. 
   - Actor: Member States
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice
   - Precondition(s): None

2. 
   - Actor: Member States
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time
   - Precondition(s): None

3. 
   - Actor: Member States
   - Modal Verb: shall
   - Modality: Obligation
   - Action(s): ensure that the required connection and metering points are established
   - Precondition(s): None

- **Criterion 1:** The choice does not include preconditions in the description of actions, which is compliant.
- **Criterion 2:** All atomic legal statements are classified as obligations. 

### Conclusion:
All three choices satisfy the criteria laid out; however, Choices 1 and 3 maintain the original phrasing with "ensure" as an action verb, while Choice 2 replaces it with "provide," which slightly alters the original intent of the directive. Based on the consistency and preservation of the original directive's tone, the best choice is 1.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are correctly extracted.
   - Each of the actions described does not include any preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - All statements are classified as obligations, which is appropriate for the context of the article. However, the third statement is more about ensuring the establishment of infrastructure rather than a direct obligation to customers, which could be seen as a permission rather than an obligation.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are accurately extracted.
   - The actions do not include preconditions, complying with Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - Each statement is classified as an obligation, which is appropriate. However, the wording "provide that" might introduce ambiguity regarding whether it implies a direct obligation or just a facilitation of conditions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Legal Statements**:
   - The statements are accurately extracted.
   - The actions do not include preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.

2. **Classification**:
   - Each statement is classified as an obligation, which aligns with the legal language and intent of the article. This choice maintains clarity and directness without introducing ambiguity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all choices, Choice 3 maintains the clearest representation of the obligations without introducing potential ambiguity in the wording. It also meets both criteria effectively. 

The best choice is 3.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the criteria provided, focusing on the extraction and modeling of legal statements from Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: There are no preconditions mentioned in the extracted statements, which means no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition exist to serve as sources for Dependencies. This does not satisfy Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: Since there are no preconditions, there cannot be any Dependencies where the source is a Precondition and the target is either an Obligation or a Permission. Thus, Criterion 2 is not satisfied.
3. **Duplication**: Each goal is described uniquely, and there are no duplicates in the descriptions, which satisfies Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions specified in the extracted statements, meaning no Goal with modality Precondition exists. This fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: Again, due to the lack of preconditions, there are no Dependencies to analyze regarding sources and targets. This fails Criterion 2 as well.
3. **Duplication**: This model, like Choice 1, does not have duplicated elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Dependency**: As with the previous choices, there are no preconditions present in the extracted legal statements, which means there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition. This does not satisfy Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency Type**: The absence of preconditions means there are no possibilities for Dependencies where the source is a Precondition and the target is either an Obligation or a Permission, failing Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: This model successfully avoids duplication of elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:

All three choices fail to meet the critical Criteria 1 and 2 regarding the presence of preconditions and the creation of dependencies. However, they all meet Criterion 3 by avoiding duplication.

Given that all choices are fundamentally similar and do not satisfy the essential criteria, the best choice is the first one simply because it is the first presented option and serves as a baseline for the analysis.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: None of the intentional elements identified have a precondition as stated in the classification. Therefore, this choice does not meet Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: Since there are no preconditions, there cannot be any dependencies established between a precondition and obligations or permissions, which violates Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications of model elements in this choice, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions for the intentional elements, which fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The absence of preconditions also means there are no dependencies that can be established, violating Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: No duplication of model elements occurs in this choice, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition**: Like the previous choices, there are no preconditions in the intentional elements, which fails Criterion 1.
2. **Dependency**: The lack of preconditions means there are also no dependencies established, violating Criterion 2.
3. **Duplication**: There are no duplications of model elements, satisfying Criterion 3.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria due to the absence of preconditions and dependencies. However, they each satisfy Criterion 3 regarding duplication. Since all choices are structurally similar and do not fulfill the critical requirements of the model, they cannot be distinguished in terms of a "best" choice based on the criteria provided.

Given that there are no effective differences in the fulfillment of the criteria across the choices, **the best choice is 1** (arbitrarily selecting the first choice, as all have similar shortcomings). 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the established criteria to determine which model best represents the requirements outlined in Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: None of the intentional elements in the model have a precondition. This means there are no IntentionalElements of type Goal with modality Precondition serving as the source of a Dependency. **(Fails Criterion 1)**
   
2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model has no dependencies at all, so it does not provide a source of a Dependency that aligns with the requirements. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: The model does not have any duplicated intentional elements; each goal is unique in its description. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no preconditions in any of the intentional elements. **(Fails Criterion 1)** 

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: The model does not include any dependencies, thereby not meeting the requirement for a source of Dependency. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplications; each intentional element is distinct. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition**: As with the previous choices, there are no IntentionalElements with modality Precondition, which means there are no sources for Dependencies. **(Fails Criterion 1)**

2. **Dependency Source and Target**: This model also does not establish any dependencies, failing to provide a source that would align with the necessary criteria. **(Fails Criterion 2)**

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicated intentional elements in this model either, as each goal is described uniquely. **(Passes Criterion 3)**

### Conclusion:

All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria regarding preconditions and dependencies, which are critical for the intended legal GRL modeling. However, they all successfully avoid duplication of model elements. Since none of the choices fulfill the core requirements effectively, it is challenging to deem one as better than the others.

Given the analysis, the best choice among the provided options is technically non-existent as none meet all criteria. However, since they all share the same shortcomings and strengths, I will select the first one as a representative option for further refinement.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: There are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition in the model.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: The source of any dependencies must be a Precondition, and the targets must be either an Obligation or a Permission. Since there are no Preconditions, this criterion is not satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: There are no duplicate model elements; each intentional element has a unique description.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: There are no dependencies defined, and again, there are no Preconditions to serve as sources for these dependencies.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: No duplicates are present in this model either.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Criterion 1 (Precondition)**: Just like the previous choices, this model does not contain any intentional elements of type Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Criterion 2 (Dependency)**: There are no dependencies defined, and the absence of Preconditions means that the requirement cannot be satisfied.
3. **Criterion 3 (Duplication)**: There are no duplicate elements; each intentional element is distinct.

### Conclusion

All three choices fail to meet the first two criteria, as they do not include any Precondition elements nor dependencies stemming from them. However, all choices satisfy Criterion 3 by avoiding duplication. Based on the analysis, none of the choices are fully compliant with the requirements of the model.

In terms of the least problematic choice, since all choices are structurally similar and fail on the same criteria, it comes down to preference in formatting and clarity. However, since each option is essentially equivalent in this context, we can select the first choice as it represents the original extraction and classification without any additional layers of complexity.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."

   - There are no duplications in model elements since each intentional element has a unique description. Thus, it meets Criterion 3.

### Choice 2 Analysis

1. **Precondition Requirement**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, there are no Preconditions present. It fails Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**:
   - There are no Dependencies defined in this model. It does not meet Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - There are no duplications in model elements, so it meets Criterion 3.

### Choice 3 Analysis

1. **Precondition Requirement**:
   - Again, there are no Preconditions present, which means it fails Criterion 1.

2. **Dependency Source and Target**:
   - There are no Dependencies defined in this model. It does not meet Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication of Model Elements**:
   - The model does not contain duplications, so it meets Criterion 3.

### Conclusion

After analyzing all three choices, none of them satisfy the essential criteria of having a Precondition, having defined Dependencies, and avoiding duplication of model elements. However, all choices are consistent in terms of the lack of Preconditions and Dependencies, and they do not contain duplicate model elements.

Since all choices share similar deficiencies but maintain unique characteristics without duplication, the best choice among them for clarity in representation and organization is:

**The best choice is 1.**

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Member States and Customers.

The model is created using the following domain:
Article 4 of EU directive 2019/944: Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*
;

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'
    'id:' id=ID
    'description:' description=STRING
    'type:' type=intentionalElementType
    ('modality:' modality=modality)?
;

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

modality: /Obligation|Permission|Precondition/;

EL: Contribution | Decomposition | Dependency;

Contribution: 'Contribution:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
    'level:' level=INT
;

Decomposition: 'Decomposition:'
    'source:' source=[IE]

    'decompositionType:' decompositionType=decompositionType
;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
#### Step 1: Analyze and Rewrite Descriptions in Propositional Logic
1. **IE1**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - P1: All customers are free to purchase from supplier of their choice.
   
   Propositional Logic: 
   - A: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.

2. **IE2**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - P2: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

   Propositional Logic:
   - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

3. **IE3**: The required connection and metering points are established.
   - P3: The required connection and metering points are established.

   Propositional Logic:
   - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 2: Create Syntax Tree
The descriptions are simple propositions without complex logical connectors, so the syntax tree is as follows:

```
       AND
       /   \
      A     B
```

#### Step 3: Create Sub Intentional Elements
1. **IE1** becomes:
   - **IE1_A**: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.
   - **IE1_AND**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and have more than one electricity supply contract.

2. **IE2** becomes:
   - **IE2_B**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **IE3** becomes:
   - **IE3_C**: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 4: Connect Elements with Decompositions
```
Decomposition of IE1:
- IE1 -> IE1_A
```
```
Decomposition of IE2:
- IE2 -> IE2_B
```
```
Decomposition of IE3:
- IE3 -> IE3_C
```

#### Step 5: Contribution Links
- Contribution from **IE1** to **IE1_A**: level = 100
- Contribution from **IE2** to **IE2_B**: level = 100

### Final Refined Legal GRL Model:

**Refine Legal GRL model:**

1. **Obligation 1 (IE1)**: Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - Propositional Logic: A
     - A: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.

2. **Obligation 2 (IE2)**: Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - Propositional Logic: B
     - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **Obligation 3 (IE3)**: Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established.
   - Propositional Logic: C
     - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

Since all atomic statements are obligations and do not have interdependencies or complex conditions needing decomposition, the refined GRL model does not require additional preconditions or permissions.

                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE2"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            Dependency:
                  source: "IE3"
                  target: "IE2"
;

    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE1
        target: IE2
    ;
    
    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE1
        target: IE3
    ;
    
    elementLinks = Dependency:
        source: IE2
        target: IE3
    ;
```

In this refined model, we have maintained the obligations as distinct entities, ensuring clarity about the responsibilities of Member States without introducing unnecessary complexities. Each obligation stands independently, reflecting the duties outlined in the article.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
To refine the model, we will analyze each obligation in the context of their propositional logic and create a hierarchical structure as per the steps outlined.

1. **Obligation 1**: "Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
   - Proposition: A: all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.

2. **Obligation 2**: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
   - Proposition: B: all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **Obligation 3**: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established."
   - Proposition: C: the required connection and metering points are established.

Since each obligation does not contain any logical connectors that require further decomposition, we will keep them as is.

Thus, the refined Legal GRL model remains simple without nested structures:

```
Model:
    actors = Actor:
        name: "Member States"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE1"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE2"
                description: "Ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Ensure that the required connection and metering points are established"
                type: Goal
                modality: Precondition
            Dependency:
                  source: "IE3"
                  target: "IE2"
;
```

In this case, the obligations are clear and straightforward, thus no additional preconditions or permissions are necessary to support the obligations as described in the legal article.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice with respect to the stated criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: The decomposition presented in this choice adheres to the criterion that only Intentional Elements of the same type and modality are decomposed. Here, all decompositions involve Obligations, which satisfies this criterion. 
2. **Target Criterion**: The decomposition of **IE1**, **IE2**, and **IE3** is into a single element, failing to meet this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition involves only Obligations for all elements, satisfying the first criterion.
2. **Target Criterion**: The model presents dependencies between the Intentional Elements, but it does not utilize decomposition that targets multiple elements from a single source. This choice fails to demonstrate a proper application of decomposition as required by the second criterion.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: As with the previous choices, this model maintains the integrity of only decomposing Obligations into Obligations, satisfying the first criterion.
2. **Target Criterion**: This choice also presents independent Obligations without any decomposition, leading to a failure in demonstrating the required connections among Intentional Elements. It does not effectively utilize the opportunity for decomposition to meet the criterion of having multiple targets.

### Conclusion:
Both Choice 1 and Choice 2 introduce some decomposition, but Choice 1 fails the second criterion due to decomposing an Obligation into a single target. Choice 2 does not demonstrate proper decomposition. Choice 3 keeps things simple but fails to leverage the opportunities for decomposition as well. 

After careful consideration of the criteria, the best choice is Choice 1, as it at least attempted to decompose with valid elements, despite failing the second criterion on one instance.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the choices presented for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, we will analyze each one based on the provided criteria. 

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model successfully decomposes "IE1" into "IE1_A" and "IE2" into "IE2_B", which are both of the same type (Goal) and modality (Obligation). This adheres to Criterion 1. "IE3" is not decomposed further, which is acceptable.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: "IE1", "IE2" and "IE3" has a single decomposition target but does not violate any rules as it's a singular obligation.

**Summary**: This choice maintains a clear structure and follows the decomposition rules well, making it a strong candidate.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: The model does not provide any decomposition. All elements remain distinct obligations without any further breakdown. This does not contradict Criterion 1 but lacks the depth that decomposition could provide.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Since there is no decomposition, Criterion 2 is not applicable here. Each obligation stands independently, which can be seen as a limitation in capturing the relationships among obligations.

**Summary**: While this model clearly outlines the obligations, it misses the opportunity for more complex relationships through decomposition, making it less robust than Choice 1.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 2, this model does not include any decomposition. All obligations are presented as separate entities without further breakdown, adhering to Criterion 1 but lacking the potential for deeper analysis.
2. **Target of Decomposition**: Again, there is no decomposition, so Criterion 2 is not applicable. The obligations are presented independently, which may limit the representation of the relationships between them.

**Summary**: Like Choice 2, this choice clearly defines the obligations but lacks any form of decomposition, making it less effective in capturing the complexities of the legal requirements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that Choice 1 provides the most comprehensive model. It effectively uses decomposition to represent the relationships among obligations while adhering to both criteria. Choice 2 and Choice 3, while clear, do not utilize decomposition and therefore miss the opportunity to capture the interconnectedness of the obligations.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria and the domain description.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations into related intentional elements. Each obligation is clearly defined without mixing different modalities (all are obligations).
   - The decomposition of **IE1** into **IE1_A** and **IE2** into **IE2_B** aligns with Criterion 1. However, **IE3** is treated as a standalone element without decomposition, which is acceptable since it does not have additional sub-elements.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of **IE1**, **IE2** and **IE3** stands alone and does not require decomposition, which does not violate this criterion.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, the obligations are well-defined and classified correctly. However, it introduces unnecessary dependencies between the obligations, which could complicate the model without adding value.
   - This choice does not decompose obligations into sub-elements, which is acceptable but may miss potential relationships.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The dependencies create a single chain of obligations rather than allowing for multiple independent intentional elements. This could lead to a violation of Criterion 2 since it may imply that one obligation depends on another unnecessarily.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - This model does not attempt to decompose the intentional elements at all, which may limit the expressiveness of the model. Each obligation is treated as independent and does not explore potential relationships.
   - The lack of decomposition misses opportunities to clarify how different obligations may support or relate to one another.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Since there are no decompositions in this choice, it does not present any issues with Criterion 2. However, it also means that the model lacks depth and interconnectivity.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices against the criteria, **Choice 1** provides the most comprehensive and structured model while adhering to both decomposition criteria. It successfully captures the obligations of the Member States without introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To determine the best choice for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model describes a decomposition of **IE1** into **IE1_A** and **IE2** into **IE2_B**, which are **Obligations**. This adheres to Criterion 1 since it only decomposes **Obligations**.
   - Additionally, **IE3** is decomposed into **IE3_C**, which is also an **Obligation**. This complies with Criterion 1.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - **IE1** is decomposed into one element (**IE1_A**),which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   - **IE2** is decomposed into one element (**IE2_B**), which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   - **IE3** is decomposed into one element (**IE3_C**), which does not meet Criterion 2, as it should target more than one Intentional Element.
   

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - There is no decomposition performed in this choice. All obligations are presented as distinct without any hierarchical relationship. This does not infringe on Criterion 1 but also does not utilize the potential of decomposition effectively.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Since there is no decomposition, Criterion 2 is not applicable here.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, there is no decomposition of the obligations. The obligations are listed independently without creating any sub-elements.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - Like Choice 2, there is no decomposition, making Criterion 2 not applicable.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the choices:
- Choice 1 performs decomposition correctly but fails to meet Criterion 2 with **IE3**.
- Choices 2 and 3 do not utilize decomposition at all and thus do not provide advantages in terms of modeling complexity.

Given the importance of fulfilling both criteria, no choice fully meets the requirements. However, since Choice 1 makes an attempt to establish a structured model (despite its flaw), it is the most advanced among the options provided.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model correctly decomposes obligations (IE1, IE2, and IE3) into their respective elements. However, it introduces a decomposition of IE1, IE2 into two sub-elements (IE1_A and IE2_B) which is suitable since both are of the same modality (Obligation) and type (Goal).
   - The decomposition of IE3 into IE3_C is also appropriate since it follows the same modality and type.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The decomposition of IE1 targets one element (IE1_A), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE2 targets one element (IE2_B), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.
   - The decomposition of IE3 targets one element (IE3_C), which does not satisfy Criterion 2 since the target must be more than one Intentional Element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - The model does not decompose any of the obligations. While this is acceptable since they are independent, the lack of decomposition does not utilize the potential for a more detailed structure.
   - Dependencies are introduced, but this does not meet the criteria for decomposition between Intentional Elements.

2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - The dependencies created do not target more than one element, which fails Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Decomposition**:
   - Similar to Choice 2, the model does not decompose any obligations. This could imply that the statements are too simple to require decomposition, but it misses an opportunity to structure them in a way that might clarify their interrelations.
   
2. **Target of Decomposition**:
   - As with Choice 2, there are no decompositions targeting multiple elements; thus, it does not satisfy Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
- **Choice 1** presents a more structured approach with the decomposition of obligations, even though it fails on the target decomposition of IE3. 
- **Choices 2 and 3** do not utilize decomposition at all, which limits their effectiveness in expressing the obligations clearly.

Given the analysis, while Choice 1 has a slight shortcoming, it still offers the best structure for understanding the obligations laid out in the legal article, particularly from the perspective of the focal actors. 

The best choice is **1**.

### Refine Legal GRL model:
#### Step 1: Analyze and Rewrite Descriptions in Propositional Logic
1. **IE1**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice.
   - P1: All customers are free to purchase from supplier of their choice.
   
   Propositional Logic: 
   - A: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.

2. **IE2**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   - P2: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

   Propositional Logic:
   - B: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract.

3. **IE3**: The required connection and metering points are established.
   - P3: The required connection and metering points are established.

   Propositional Logic:
   - C: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 2: Create Syntax Tree
The descriptions are simple propositions without complex logical connectors, so the syntax tree is as follows:

```
       AND
       /   \
      A     B
```

#### Step 3: Create Sub Intentional Elements
1. **IE1** becomes:
   - **IE1_A**: All customers are free to purchase from the supplier of their choice.
   - **IE1_AND**: All customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and have more than one electricity supply contract.

2. **IE2** becomes:
   - **IE2_B**: All customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.

3. **IE3** becomes:
   - **IE3_C**: The required connection and metering points are established.

#### Step 4: Connect Elements with Decompositions
```
Decomposition of IE1:
- IE1 -> IE1_A
```
```
Decomposition of IE2:
- IE2 -> IE2_B
```
```
Decomposition of IE3:
- IE3 -> IE3_C
```

#### Step 5: Contribution Links
- Contribution from **IE1** to **IE1_A**: level = 100
- Contribution from **IE2** to **IE2_B**: level = 100
