Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria: 

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**: This choice effectively breaks down the law article into atomic statements from the perspective of the HIC. Each statement is clear and specific, detailing the actions HIC must take.
2. **Preconditions**: The preconditions for clauses starting with "if" are well represented. The conditions under which consent must be express are clearly stated.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**: This choice presents the statements in a slightly less granular way than Choice 1. While it captures the essence, it combines multiple conditions into one point, which may obscure the atomicity needed for clarity.
2. **Preconditions**: The preconditions are listed in a clear manner, but the lack of separation for conditions under which express consent is needed could lead to ambiguity about when HIC must act.

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**: This choice effectively captures the legal requirements with good clarity and separation of actions. Each statement is distinct and focuses on a single action or requirement.
2. **Preconditions**: The preconditions are well articulated, particularly for the express consent requirement, which is detailed in terms of different scenarios.

### Conclusion:
While all choices have merit, Choice 1 stands out for its clear and distinct atomicity in the statements it extracts, as well as its effective handling of preconditions. It presents the information in a way that is straightforward and easy to interpret from the perspective of HIC.

**The best choice is 1.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

**Choice 1:**
1. The atomic statements are clearly articulated from the perspective of HIC, capturing the obligations and conditions under which consent must be obtained. 
2. The preconditions for clauses starting with "if" are clearly identified, particularly in statements 6 and 7. 

However, the phrasing of some statements could be more precise. For example, in statement 5, it suggests a conditionality ("may") without clearly linking it to the necessity of consent being express or implied.

**Choice 2:**
1. The statements are clear and concise, effectively capturing the essence of the legal requirements from the perspective of HIC. It summarizes the conditions associated with consent well.
2. The preconditions are adequately extracted, especially in statement 3, which identifies the conditions under which express consent is required.

However, the first statement could be seen as somewhat broad. It combines the obligations without explicitly stating that they are conditional upon the requirement for consent.

**Choice 3:**
1. The atomic statements are clearly delineated, and the perspective of HIC is maintained throughout. It explicitly states the requirements for consent in a structured manner.
2. The preconditions are accurately extracted and presented, particularly in the sections detailing when express consent must be obtained.

However, it does not specify that consent may be express or implied distinctly and could be a bit more succinct in its phrasing.

**Conclusion:**
While all choices provide valuable insights, Choice 1 stands out in terms of clarity in expressing preconditions and obligations from HIC's perspective. It provides a comprehensive breakdown of the legal requirements while also clearly indicating the conditions under which HIC must operate. 

Thus, "The best choice is 1."

 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided:

### Choice 1:
1. **HIC must obtain consent if the consent of an individual is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - **Analysis**: This statement effectively captures the requirement for consent, focusing on the focal actor (HIC). It indicates the precondition of needing consent.
   
2. **HIC must ensure that consent is knowledgeable if the consent is required.**
   - **Analysis**: This statement identifies the requirement that the consent must be knowledgeable. It captures a specific aspect of consent but lacks the clarity of a precondition.

3. **HIC must obtain consent if the consent relates to the information being collected, used, or disclosed.**
   - **Analysis**: This statement also appropriately identifies a necessary condition for consent.

4. **HIC must not obtain consent through deception or coercion.**
   - **Analysis**: This is a clear guideline that does not specify a precondition but is essential for compliance.

5. **HIC may obtain consent expressly or impliedly for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - **Analysis**: This adequately captures the flexibility around consent without a precondition.

6. **HIC must obtain express consent if the disclosure of personal health information is made to a person that is not a health information custodian.**
   - **Analysis**: This clearly states the requirement for express consent with a direct precondition.

7. **HIC must obtain express consent if the disclosure is made to another health information custodian and is not for the purposes of providing health care or assisting in providing health care.**
   - **Analysis**: This statement captures a specific condition for obtaining express consent and clearly identifies the necessary precondition.

### Choice 2:
1. **HIC must obtain consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - **Analysis**: This is a broad statement encompassing the requirements, with a list of preconditions. It is clear but less detailed in terms of individual actions.

2. **HIC may collect, use, or disclose personal health information with express or implied consent.**
   - **Analysis**: This captures the general permission for consent but lacks detail on preconditions.

3. **HIC must obtain express consent for the disclosure of personal health information if:**
   - **Analysis**: This clearly identifies the need for express consent and lists specific preconditions, which is beneficial.

### Choice 3:
1. **HIC must obtain consent.**
   - **Analysis**: This statement is clear but lacks the context of when consent is required. The preconditions are well listed, reflecting the law accurately.

2. **HIC may collect, use, or disclose personal health information.**
   - **Analysis**: This captures permission but is broad and lacks specificity regarding preconditions.

3. **HIC must obtain express consent.**
   - **Analysis**: This is well articulated and clearly states the preconditions, aligning closely with the legal requirements.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all three choices against the criteria, Choice 1 effectively captures the necessary atomic statements from the law article while maintaining clarity on the focal actor's responsibilities. It clearly distinguishes between actions and preconditions in a detailed manner. Although Choices 2 and 3 present valid options, they fall short in either detail or clarity about preconditions. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **HIC must obtain consent if the consent of an individual is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - This statement correctly extracts an atomic legal statement and identifies a precondition.

2. **HIC must ensure that consent is knowledgeable if the consent is required.**
   - This statement is clear and includes a precondition related to the knowledge requirement for consent.

3. **HIC must obtain consent if the consent relates to the information being collected, used, or disclosed.**
   - This accurately reflects the requirement and includes a precondition.

4. **HIC must not obtain consent through deception or coercion.**
   - This is a clear atomic statement but does not include a precondition, which is acceptable since it is a direct obligation.

5. **HIC may obtain consent expressly or impliedly for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - This is a valid statement regarding the type of consent but lacks a specific precondition, which could be considered a limitation.

6. **HIC must obtain express consent if the disclosure of personal health information is made to a person that is not a health information custodian.**
   - This is a strong statement with a clear precondition.

7. **HIC must obtain express consent if the disclosure is made to another health information custodian and is not for the purposes of providing health care or assisting in providing health care.**
   - This is also a solid statement with a clear precondition.

### Choice 2:
1. **HIC must obtain consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.**
   - This captures a necessary obligation but does not explicitly state the preconditions as individual statements, which could reduce clarity.

2. **HIC may collect, use, or disclose personal health information with express or implied consent.**
   - This statement is accurate but lacks specific preconditions.

3. **HIC must obtain express consent for the disclosure of personal health information if:**
   - This is well-structured and includes the necessary preconditions, providing clarity.

### Choice 3:
1. **Health Information Custodian (HIC) must obtain consent.**
   - This is a clear statement, but it could be more explicit about the context of preconditions.

2. **Health Information Custodian (HIC) may collect, use, or disclose personal health information.**
   - This is accurate and includes the necessary context for consent type but does not explicitly state preconditions.

3. **Health Information Custodian (HIC) must obtain express consent.**
   - This statement is clear and specifies the contextual preconditions well.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing all three choices, **Choice 1** stands out as the most comprehensive and detailed. It effectively extracts atomic statements and clearly delineates preconditions in a manner that is easy for a focal actor (HIC) to understand and act upon. The other choices, while valid, either lack clarity in precondition extraction or do not provide the same level of detail.

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:** 
   - The statements extracted are atomic and appropriately reflect the obligations of the Health Information Custodian (HIC). Each statement is clear and concise, directly addressing actions that the HIC must take.
2. **Preconditions:**
   - The preconditions are correctly identified for clauses that start with "if," indicating the specific scenarios under which certain actions must occur. This includes the conditions for express consent and the general requirement of obtaining consent.

Overall, Choice 1 excels in providing clear atomic statements and accurately capturing the preconditions required by the law article.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:**
   - This choice provides a more generalized format for the atomic statements, which could make it less precise in some instances. The first statement mixes multiple preconditions into a single atomic action, which could dilute the clarity of responsibilities.
2. **Preconditions:**
   - The preconditions listed under the first statement are comprehensive, but the overall organization might lead to confusion about which preconditions apply to which actions. The second statement lacks preconditions, which is a critical oversight since it should specify the requirement of express or implied consent.

Choice 2 does have some strengths, but it lacks clarity in atomic statements and organization, leading to potential misunderstandings.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Atomic Statements:**
   - The atomic statements are clearly articulated. They reflect the actions that HIC must take and maintain the focus on the subject.
2. **Preconditions:**
   - The preconditions are well-defined and closely align with the requirements outlined in the law article. The use of "if" in the statements effectively highlights the conditions under which certain actions are necessary.

Choice 3 provides a strong presentation of atomic statements and preconditions, maintaining clarity and focus on the role of HIC.

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluating all three choices, Choice 1 stands out for its clarity, precision, and effective use of preconditions associated with the actions required of the HIC. While Choices 2 and 3 have merits, they either blend conditions or lack specificity in some areas.

The best choice is 1.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

### Analysis of Choices:

**Choice 1:**
- **Criterion 1:** There are multiple statements that include preconditions (e.g., "if the consent of an individual is required..."). This violates the requirement to exclude preconditions from the action description.
- **Criterion 2:** Each atomic legal statement is classified correctly as either an obligation or a permission, which is compliant with the criterion.

**Choice 2:**
- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, this option also includes preconditions in almost all statements, such as "if the consent of an individual is required...".
- **Criterion 2:** It correctly classifies each atomic legal statement as either an obligation or a permission.

**Choice 3:**
- **Criterion 1:** This choice also suffers from the inclusion of preconditions in the descriptions of actions, for example, "if the consent of an individual is required...".
- **Criterion 2:** The classification of obligations and permissions is also correct for each atomic legal statement.

### Conclusion:
All three choices failed to meet Criterion 1 due to the presence of preconditions in the action descriptions. However, they all correctly classified the statements according to Criterion 2. Given that no choice fully adheres to both criteria, but recognizing that they all equally exhibit the same deficiency with Criterion 1, we can conclude that they are equivalent in failing to meet the requirements.

The best choice is 1, as it was the first provided option and represents the original attempt to extract atomic legal statements. Therefore, the final selection is:

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 ### Analysis of Choices

**Choice 1:**
- **Criterion 1:** Fails to meet this criterion because all statements include preconditions, such as "if the consent of an individual is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information".
- **Criterion 2:** Meets this criterion as all atomic legal statements are classified correctly as either obligations or permissions.

**Choice 2:**
- **Criterion 1:** Similar to Choice 1, it fails this criterion because every atomic legal statement contains preconditions (e.g., "if the consent of an individual is required...").
- **Criterion 2:** This choice also classifies all statements correctly into obligations or permissions.

**Choice 3:**
- **Criterion 1:** Like the previous choices, this fails to meet the criterion since each statement includes preconditions ("if the consent of an individual is required...").
- **Criterion 2:** It successfully classifies the statements into obligations and permissions.

### Conclusion
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1, as they all include descriptions of preconditions in their atomic legal statements. However, they all meet Criterion 2 by correctly categorizing the obligations and permissions. Since none of the choices are fully compliant with both criteria, there is no single best choice. However, since they are all equivalent in this respect, the best choice is 1, as it is the first presented option.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Analyzing the three choices based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Each statement contains preconditions, violating this criterion. For instance, statements such as "must obtain consent if the consent of an individual is required..." clearly state preconditions.
2. **Criterion 2**: The classification of legal statements is mostly correct, with obligations and permissions identified appropriately. However, since many statements contain preconditions, this impacts the overall validity of the model.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice also includes preconditions in nearly all statements, which contravenes the requirement to avoid preconditions in the description of actions.
2. **Criterion 2**: The classification of obligations and permissions is done correctly. However, the presence of preconditions detracts from the overall compliance with the model's purpose.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Like the previous choices, this choice includes preconditions in the majority of statements. For example, "must obtain consent if the consent of an individual is required..." explicitly mentions preconditions, violating the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The classification of the actions is handled correctly, with obligations and permissions identified. However, the presence of preconditions undermines the effectiveness of the model.

### Conclusion:
All three choices fail to meet Criterion 1 due to the presence of preconditions in the actions described. However, they all correctly classify the legal statements as obligations or permissions in accordance with Criterion 2. Since none of the choices meets the criteria fully, the best choice, in terms of clarity and correctness of action classification, is **Choice 3**, due to its consistent structure and clarity in actions described, despite the preconditions.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail according to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Several statements include preconditions, such as "if the consent of an individual is required..." and "if the consent is required." This means the model does not adhere to the first criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All atomic statements are properly classified as either obligations or permissions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, many statements contain preconditions, which is not compliant with the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All statements are classified correctly as obligations or permissions.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: This choice also contains preconditions in multiple statements, violating the first criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The classification of all statements as obligations or permissions is correctly executed.

### Conclusion:
All choices fail the first criterion regarding the inclusion of preconditions in the description of actions. However, they all successfully classify atomic legal statements as obligations or permissions. Since none of the choices fully meet the criteria, but they are otherwise similarly structured, a final judgment cannot be made on the basis of the criteria provided.

Given the context and the need to choose one, I would argue that all choices are equally deficient in the same way, but if forced to select, I would choose based on the first instance that provided a clear structure, which is Choice 1. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Several statements include preconditions, such as "if the consent of an individual is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information," which violates this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All atomic legal statements are classified correctly, being either obligations or permissions.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, multiple statements contain preconditions. For example, "if the consent of an individual is required," which is not acceptable according to the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The classification of atomic legal statements is done correctly.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: This choice also suffers from the same issue as the previous two; several statements include preconditions which violate the criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All statements are classified properly into obligations or permissions.

### Conclusion:
None of the choices fully satisfy the requirement of Criterion 1, as they all include preconditions in the descriptions of actions. However, since the classification of obligations and permissions is done correctly in all choices, they are all equally flawed in this regard. 

Given the lack of options that meet the criteria, if forced to select the least problematic option, all choices are equally valid regarding the classification but fail on the precondition aspect.

The best choice is **1**, since it is the first presented choice and serves as a reference for the others, even though all choices have the same issues regarding preconditions.

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

 ### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:

- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: The extraction includes seven distinct obligations and permissions relating to consent, all attributed to the Health Information Custodian (HIC).
  
- **Classification**:
  - **Obligations**: 1. Obtain consent if required; 2. Ensure consent is knowledgeable; 3. Obtain consent if it relates to information; 4. Must not obtain consent through deception; 6. Obtain express consent if disclosed to non-custodian; 7. Obtain express consent if not for health care purposes.
  - **Permission**: 5. May obtain consent expressly or impliedly.

- **Dependencies**: 
  - Dependencies are established correctly, where sources of dependencies are obligations (IE1, IE2, IE5, IE6, IE7) and the targets are either obligations or permissions, which adheres to the specified criteria.

- **Duplications**: There is duplication in IE3 and IE5 since they both describe "obtain consent" but in different contexts. This violates Criterion 3.

#### Choice 2:

- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: Similar to Choice 1, it presents seven obligations and permissions regarding consent for the HIC.

- **Classification**: The classification is identical to Choice 1; however, it notes the need for distinct naming or descriptions to avoid duplication.

- **Dependencies**: The dependencies are structured well following the criteria. The source elements (obligations) lead to valid targets (either obligations or permissions).

- **Duplications**: The same issue of duplication exists as in Choice 1 with "obtain consent" being represented multiple times (IE1, IE3, IE5). This contravenes Criterion 3.

#### Choice 3:

- **Extracted Atomic Statements**: This choice also reflects the same seven obligations and permissions related to consent. 

- **Classification**: The classification is consistent with the previous choices, but again suffers from the duplication of "obtain consent".

- **Dependencies**: The dependencies are set up, but there are obvious issues due to incorrect linking (e.g., sources pointing to themselves, which is nonsensical).

- **Duplications**: It repeats the same problematic duplications of "obtain consent" (IE1, IE3, IE5).

### Conclusion

All three choices fail to meet Criterion 3 due to the duplication of model elements with the same description. Additionally, while they adhere to Criteria 1 and 2 concerning dependency structures, the overall quality is compromised by the duplication issue.

However, given that Choice 1 and Choice 2 present valid structures and logical dependencies without nonsensical elements, they are preferable to Choice 3 which contains errors in dependency linking. 

Thus, after careful consideration, **the best choice is 1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria carefully.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: Each Dependency source must be a «Precondition» of type Goal. In this choice, the sources of Dependencies (IE1, IE2, IE5, IE6, IE7) align correctly with this criterion as they are linked to valid precondition goals.
  
2. **Criterion 2**: The sources of Dependencies must be a «Precondition», and the targets must be either an «Obligation» or a «Permission». This criterion is satisfied as the targets for each Dependency (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE6, IE7) are indeed Obligations or Permissions.

3. **Criterion 3**: There should be no duplication of model elements with the same description. In this model, there are duplicates in the descriptions (e.g., "obtain consent" is repeated). Therefore, this criterion is violated.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: The sources of Dependencies (IE1, IE2, IE5, IE6, IE7) align with «Precondition» goals, meeting this criterion.

2. **Criterion 2**: The targets of Dependencies are valid, with all being Obligations or Permissions. Thus, this criterion is satisfied.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are duplicates in the descriptions (e.g., "obtain consent" appears multiple times). This violates the criterion.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: The sources of Dependencies (IE1, IE2, IE5, IE6, IE7) are valid precondition goals, meeting this criterion.

2. **Criterion 2**: All targets of the Dependencies are either Obligations or Permissions, fulfilling this criterion.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are numerous duplicates in the descriptions (e.g., "obtain consent" appears multiple times). This criterion is violated.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing each choice, all options have issues with duplication of model elements. However, the best choice in terms of meeting the criteria as closely as possible is **Choice 1**, as it has a clearer structuring of dependencies and preconditions, despite the duplication issue. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each of the choices based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: The model includes a **Precondition** (the consent of an individual is required) that is the source of a **Dependency** (IE1 to IE2, IE1 to IE3). This satisfies the criterion.

2. **Criterion 2**: The sources of Dependencies are **Preconditions** (IE1, which states the requirement of consent), targeting **Obligations** (IE2, IE3, IE6, IE7). This is in compliance with the criterion.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are duplications in the model with the same description for "obtain consent" (IE1, IE3, IE5). This violates the criterion against duplication.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, it includes a **Precondition** (IE1) that is the source of a **Dependency** (IE1 to IE2, IE1 to IE3). This meets the criterion.

2. **Criterion 2**: The sources of Dependencies are **Preconditions** (IE1) leading to **Obligations** (IE2, IE3, IE6, IE7). This is compliant with the criterion.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are still duplications for "obtain consent" (IE1, IE3, IE5). This violates the criterion against duplication.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: It has a **Precondition** (IE1) as the source of a **Dependency** (IE1 to IE2, IE1 to IE3), which satisfies the criterion.

2. **Criterion 2**: The sources of Dependencies are **Preconditions** (IE1) and target **Obligations** (IE2, IE3, IE6, IE7), which complies with the criterion.

3. **Criterion 3**: The model contains multiple duplications under the description "obtain consent" (IE1, IE3, IE5), violating the criterion against duplication.

### Conclusion

All three choices meet the first two criteria, but all fail on Criterion 3 due to the duplication of model elements. However, Choice 1, Choice 2, and Choice 3 all have similar issues with duplication and do not clearly stand out in terms of compliance.

Given that all choices exhibit the same fundamental issues, the best choice is the one that presents the most coherent and structured approach even within the constraints of duplication.

**The best choice is 1.**
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: There are several dependencies where the source is a «Precondition» goal. For example, IE1 ("obtain consent") has dependencies to IE2 ("ensure that consent is knowledgeable") and IE3 ("obtain consent").
2. **Criterion 2**: The dependencies correctly reflect that the source of dependencies is a «Precondition» and targets are either an «Obligation» or a «Permission». For instance, IE1 (Goal of obtaining consent) leads to obligations like IE2 and IE3.
3. **Criterion 3**: There are duplications in the model. The description "obtain consent" appears multiple times (IE1, IE3, and IE5), violating the criterion against duplication.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The model has several dependencies sourced from a «Precondition», fulfilling this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: All dependencies conform to the requirement that the source is a «Precondition» and targets are either an «Obligation» or a «Permission».
3. **Criterion 3**: There are duplications present where "obtain consent" appears in multiple intentional elements (IE1, IE3, and IE5).

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Criterion 1**: The dependencies are appropriately linked to a «Precondition» goal, satisfying this criterion.
2. **Criterion 2**: The model follows the rules for dependencies correctly, with sources being «Precondition» goals leading to either obligations or permissions.
3. **Criterion 3**: There is a significant flaw with duplication as "obtain consent" is repeated in IE1, IE3, and IE5. 

### Conclusion:
All choices present issues with criterion 3 due to the duplication of model elements with the same description. However, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 follow the dependency rules more strictly than Choice 3. Between Choices 1 and 2, both present similar issues regarding duplication, but Choice 2 presents a more structured format for the model, making it easier to follow.

Given that all choices have a violation of criterion 3, but Choices 1 and 2 perform better overall in structure and adherence to the rules of dependency, **the best choice is 2**. 

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice with respect to the criteria specified.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: Each of the intentional elements that represent obligations (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE6, IE7) correctly identifies a precondition. For example, IE1 has the precondition that consent is required.
   
2. **Dependency Relationships**: Dependencies are correctly established, with the source being a «Precondition» and the target being either an «Obligation» or a «Permission». For example, IE1 (goal) leads to IE2 (goal) and IE3 (goal), which aligns with the defined dependencies.

3. **Duplication Check**: There is duplication in the descriptions in this model. IE1 and IE3 both describe "obtain consent," which violates the criterion of no duplication.

Overall, while this choice is structured well, the duplication of intentional elements is a critical flaw.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: Similar to Choice 1, all intentional elements that represent obligations have appropriate preconditions linked to them.

2. **Dependency Relationships**: The dependencies are well-defined, with appropriate sources and targets as required by the criteria. For instance, the dependencies from IE1 to IE2 and IE3 maintain the integrity of the model.

3. **Duplication Check**: This choice also shows duplication of the description "obtain consent" between IE1 and IE3, which is not allowed.

Despite having well-defined dependencies and appropriate preconditions, the duplication issue undermines this model.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
1. **Precondition Source**: The preconditions for all intentional elements that represent obligations are correctly identified. Each IE has a proper precondition that corresponds to the conditions in the law article.

2. **Dependency Relationships**: There are dependencies established between intentional elements that meet the criteria, with correct sourcing and targeting.

3. **Duplication Check**: The model has significant duplication issues. For instance, both IE1 and IE3 describe "obtain consent," leading to a direct violation of the no-duplication criterion.

Like the previous choices, while the structure is generally sound, the presence of duplicates is a major issue.

### Conclusion:
All three choices have similar structural integrity but suffer from the same critical issue of duplication in intentional elements. Given the criteria, none of the choices can be considered ideal due to the duplicate elements. However, if a choice must be made where the structure is generally the most coherent and aligns best with the criteria, we can tentatively conclude:

The best choice is 1.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: HIC.

The model is created using the following domain:
18 (1) If this Act or any other Act requires the consent of an individual for the collection, use or disclosure of personal health information by a health information custodian, the consent,
(a)  must be a consent of the individual;
(b)  must be knowledgeable;
(c)  must relate to the information; and
(d)  must not be obtained through deception or coercion.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 18 (1).
(2) Subject to subsection (3), a consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal health information about an individual may be express or implied.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 18 (2).
(3) A consent to the disclosure of personal health information about an individual must be express, and not implied, if,
(a)  a health information custodian makes the disclosure to a person that is not a health information custodian; or
(b)  a health information custodian makes the disclosure to another health information custodian and the disclosure is not for the purposes of providing health care or assisting in providing health care.  2004, c. 3, Sched. A, s. 18 (3).

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*

    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

### Refine Legal GRL model:

Following the specified refinement steps, we will analyze the intentional elements and extract logical propositions.

1. **IE1**: Obtain consent
   - Propositional Logic: A: the consent of an individual is required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       A
   ```

2. **IE2**: Ensure that consent is knowledgeable
   - Propositional Logic: B: the consent is required.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       B
   ```

3. **IE3**: Obtain consent
   - Propositional Logic: C: the consent relates to the information being collected, used, or disclosed.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       C
   ```

4. **IE4**: Obtain consent through deception or coercion
   - Propositional Logic: D: N/A.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       D
   ```

5. **IE5**: Obtain consent
   - Propositional Logic: E: expressly or impliedly for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal health information.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       E
   ```

6. **IE6**: Obtain express consent
   - Propositional Logic: F: the disclosure of personal health information is made to a person that is not a health information custodian.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       F
   ```

7. **IE7**: Obtain express consent
   - Propositional Logic: G: the disclosure is made to another health information custodian and is not for the purposes of providing health care or assisting in providing health care.
   - Syntax Tree:
   ```
       G
   ```

Now, we will create sub-intentional elements based on the logical formula interpretations and establish the necessary decomposition and dependency relationships.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria for the Legal GRL models derived from law articles.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - The model decomposes obligations into preconditions and other obligations. This means it adheres to Criterion 1 since each intentional element is only decomposed into elements of the same type and modality.
   - However, there are some intentional elements that are not grouped correctly, such as obligations being decomposed into permissions, which could lead to non-compliance with the criteria.

2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**:
   - The decomposition targets more than one intentional element in several instances (e.g., IE1 decomposed into IE2, IE3). This aligns with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition is performed correctly, maintaining the same modality within the groups. All obligations are decomposed into other obligations and preconditions appropriately, fulfilling Criterion 1.

2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**:
   - This model also adheres to Criterion 2, as it targets multiple intentional elements during decomposition.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Criterion**:
   - This model maintains a strict adherence to the decomposition criterion, as all intentional elements are consistently decomposed within their respective types and modalities.

2. **Target of Decomposition Criterion**:
   - It targets more than one intentional element in its decompositions, fulfilling Criterion 2 as well.

### Conclusion:

- **Choice 1** is less optimal due to improper grouping of intentional elements and potential issues with decomposition types where obligations and permissions might be mixed.
- **Choice 2** has a solid structure and adheres to both criteria well, but it does not seem to provide the most refined model available.
- **Choice 3** is the best option as it adheres strictly to both decomposition criteria and maintains clarity in intentional elements and their relationships.

Thus, after analyzing all the choices in detail, **The best choice is 3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the three choices for generating Legal GRL models from the law article provided, we will analyze each choice based on the criteria outlined: 

1. **Criterion 1**: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.

### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:
- **Decompositions**:
  - **IE1** decomposes into **IE_A, IE_B, IE_C** (Precondition elements): This is valid as all targets are of the same modality (Precondition).
  - **IE5** decomposes into **IE_E** (only one target): This fails Criterion 2 as the target is a single element.
  - **IE6** and **IE7** both decompose into **IE4** (only one target): This also fails Criterion 2.

While it has some valid decompositions, it ultimately fails to meet the requirements of both Criteria 1 and 2 due to the single targets in some decompositions.

#### Choice 2:
- **Decompositions**:
  - **IE1** decomposes into **IE8** (only one target): This fails Criterion 2.
  - **IE5** decomposes into **IE_E** (only one target): This fails Criterion 2 again.
  - Other decompositions like **IE6** and **IE7** are valid, but they don’t rectify the previous failures.

Choice 2 fails to meet Criterion 2 multiple times, invalidating the overall model.

#### Choice 3:
- **Decompositions**:
  - **IE1** decomposes into **IE8** (only one target): This fails Criterion 2.
  - **IE5** decomposes into **IE_E** (only one target): This also fails Criterion 2.
  - **IE6** and **IE7** decompose into **IE11** and **IE12** respectively, which are valid, but similarly, do not compensate for prior failures.

Choice 3 also suffers from failures in Criterion 2, rendering it invalid.

### Conclusion
All three choices contain significant flaws in their decompositions. However, Choice 1, despite its failures, does have multiple valid decompositions that follow Criterion 1 correctly, even though it fails Criterion 2 in some instances. 

On the other hand, Choices 2 and 3 both present multiple failures to meet the criteria, particularly Criterion 2.

Thus, considering the analysis, the best choice is **1**. 

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 To evaluate the three choices for generating Legal GRL models from the law articles, we will analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: 
   - The decomposition in this model follows the rule that intentional elements of the same type and modality are decomposed correctly. Each "Obligation" is decomposed into other "Obligations" (e.g., IE1 into IE2, IE3), and the "Permission" (IE5) is treated separately. 
   - This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Decomposition Target Criterion**: 
   - Each decomposition has more than one target intentional element, except for the single target in IE5's decomposition (IE_E). However, the rest of the decompositions meet the requirement. 
   - This partially satisfies Criterion 2, but the single target in one case indicates a lack of full compliance.

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also adheres to the decomposition rules by ensuring that "Obligations" are decomposed correctly and “Permissions” are handled separately.
   - This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Decomposition Target Criterion**: 
   - The decompositions generally meet the criterion of having multiple targets. However, just like Choice 1, the presence of single target decompositions indicates a partial non-compliance.
   - This also partially satisfies Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Decomposition Criterion**: 
   - The decomposition in Choice 3 follows the same structure as in the previous choices. There is strict adherence to the decomposition rules, with intentional elements of the same type and modality being correctly decomposed.
   - This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Decomposition Target Criterion**: 
   - The model includes more than one target in most decompositions, with a specific focus on ensuring that all intentional elements are involved in a structured manner.
   - This satisfies Criterion 2 fully.

### Conclusion
After analyzing all three choices, it is evident that while all choices maintain a level of compliance with the criteria, Choice 3 stands out due to its comprehensive adherence to both decomposition criteria without the partial non-compliance seen in Choices 1 and 2. 

The best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the three choices for modeling the Legal GRL based on the provided law article and the specified criteria, we will analyze each option in detail.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - The decomposition in this model follows the criteria as it ensures that intentional elements of the same type and modality are decomposed correctly. For instance, obligations are decomposed into other obligations and permissions into permissions.
   - However, some intentional elements are decomposed into singular targets (e.g., IE5 into IE1), which does not satisfy Criterion 2, as it requires the decomposition to have more than one target.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model includes instances where the decomposition targets only one element, violating Criterion 2. For example, the decomposition of IE5 into IE1 does not fulfill the requirement for multiple targets in decomposition.

### Conclusion for Choice 1:
This model fails to meet both criteria effectively, as it has issues with decomposition and the number of targets. Therefore, it is not the best choice.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - Similar to Choice 1, this model adheres to the decomposition requirement for intentional elements of the same type and modality, ensuring proper categorization of obligations and permissions.
   - It also attempts to differentiate between the elements and their relationships appropriately.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - There are still cases where intentional elements are decomposed into singular targets, which violates Criterion 2. For example, the decomposition of IE5 still leads to IE1, which is singular.

### Conclusion for Choice 2:
This model also struggles with the second criterion regarding the number of targets in decomposition. The issues identified make it less favorable for the intended purpose.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition**: 
   - This model adheres to the decomposition rules by ensuring that elements of the same modality are properly grouped. It categorizes obligations and permissions distinctly.
   - The model introduces more intentional elements to provide clarity and coverage of the requirements specified in the law article.

2. **Target of Decomposition**: 
   - The model ensures that decompositions target more than one intentional element where applicable, which aligns with Criterion 2. For instance, it effectively breaks down obligations into multiple preconditions.

### Conclusion for Choice 3:
Choice 3 addresses both criteria adequately. It maintains proper decomposition and ensures that the targets in those decompositions meet the requirement of having more than one intentional element where necessary. 

### Final Decision:
After analyzing all three choices against the specified criteria, the model that best fits the requirements is Choice 3.

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 To evaluate the three choices based on the provided criteria for generating Legal GRL models from law articles, we must analyze each choice against the two criteria:

1. **Criterion 1**: Decomposition is only between Intentional Elements of the same type and modality.
2. **Criterion 2**: The target of the Decomposition must be more than one Intentional Element.

**Choice 1 Analysis**:
- The decomposition relationships seem to appropriately connect Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. For instance, the decomposition of IE1 into IE_A, IE_B, and IE_C satisfies the criteria.
- However, there is a decomposition of IE5 into a single target (IE_E), which does not satisfy Criterion 2, as the target must be more than one Intentional Element.
- Therefore, this choice does not fully comply with both criteria.

**Choice 2 Analysis**:
- Similar to Choice 1, the decomposition relationships mostly maintain the integrity of types and modalities. The decomposition of IE1 into multiple targets (IE8, IE9, IE10) adheres to both criteria.
- The dependency relationships also seem to be defined correctly, and there are no violations of the criteria.
- However, this choice has a similar issue as Choice 1 with IE5 being decomposed into a single element. This means it does not fully comply with Criterion 2.

**Choice 3 Analysis**:
- This choice seems to better adhere to the criteria than the previous two. The decomposition of IE1, IE6, and IE7 into their respective preconditions satisfies both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, as they link to multiple targets.
- The intentional elements are clearly defined, and decomposition is consistently maintained between elements of the same type and modality, without any single target decompositions.
- Overall, this choice appears to comply with both criteria effectively.

**Conclusion**: After analyzing all three choices against the specified criteria, it is evident that **Choice 3** stands out as the most compliant with both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, making it the best choice.

The best choice is 3.
