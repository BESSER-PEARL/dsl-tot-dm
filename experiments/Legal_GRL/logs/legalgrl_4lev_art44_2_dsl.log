Your task is to Extract Atomic Legal Statements from Law Article: 
Your task is to extract atomic legal statements from the law article given, focusing on the specified actors. Please note that atomic legal statements have the format: one <actor> (the subject), one <modal verb> (modality), one to many <actions>, and 0 to many <precondition> under which the action(s) should be taken. 
Preconditions are often expressed in law articles as conditional clauses starting with 'if'. When there are multiple parallel conditional clauses led by one 'if', capture them in one atomic legal statement.
Take into account that an atomic statement can have no precondition.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail with respect to the specified criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must create a research plan in writing."
   - "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."

**Analysis**: 
- This choice successfully extracts atomic statements from the law article, clearly outlining the requirements for researchers. 
- The use of "must" indicates obligatory actions, which aligns with the legal nature of the statements. 
- However, there is no mention of any conditions or preconditions that might apply to these actions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing."
   - "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan."
   - "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."

**Analysis**: 
- Similar to Choice 1, this choice extracts clear atomic statements from the law article.
- The wording "prepare" and "indicate" offers slight variations in tone but does not alter the fundamental meaning.
- Like Choice 1, this choice lacks any conditional clauses or preconditions that start with "if."

### Choice 3:
1. **Atomic Statements**: 
   - "Researchers must have a written research plan."
   - "Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research."
   - "Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research."
   - "Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate."
   - "Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research."

**Analysis**: 
- This choice also successfully extracts atomic statements, but the phrasing is slightly varied (e.g., "have a written research plan" vs. "create a research plan in writing").
- It maintains clarity and adheres to legal framing.
- Once again, this choice does not address any conditional statements or preconditions.

### Conclusion:
Upon analyzing the three choices, all options effectively extract atomic legal statements from the law article. However, none of the options include any preconditions that are necessary for clauses starting with "if," which is a significant oversight.

In terms of clarity and legal accuracy, all choices are relatively equal. However, Choice 2 stands out slightly due to the use of "prepare" and "indicate," which might be seen as more aligned with typical legal language.

The best choice is 2.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the choices in the context of generating Legal GRL models from law articles for researchers, we will analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** The statements clearly indicate what is required from the researchers, maintaining a focus on each individual requirement. Each statement is action-oriented and specifies what researchers must do regarding their research plan.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** There are no conditional clauses starting with "if" in the domain description, so this criterion is not applicable here. However, the structure allows for easy identification of obligations.

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** Similar to Choice 1, this choice also effectively presents the required actions for researchers. The terminology "prepare" and "indicate" provides a slightly different nuance than "create" and "outline," but retains the clarity of obligations.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** Again, no conditional clauses are present, so this criterion does not apply, but the clarity remains high.

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
1. **Atomic Statements:** This choice uses different verbs such as "have," "set out," "define," and "articulate." While these verbs convey similar meanings, they introduce a different tone. For example, "have" may imply possession rather than a proactive requirement, which could lead to ambiguity regarding the obligation to create the plan.
2. **Preconditions for Clauses:** As with the previous choices, there are no conditional clauses, making this analysis irrelevant here.

**Conclusion:**
All choices effectively extract atomic statements from the law article. However, Choices 1 and 2 maintain a more direct and action-oriented language that clearly delineates the researchers' obligations, which aligns better with the requirement for generating Legal GRL models. Between these two, Choice 1 uses "create" and "outline," which might better emphasize the active role of researchers in the process. Choice 2's use of "prepare" and "indicate" also works well but is slightly less emphatic.

Thus, the best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the criteria provided.

**Choice 1:**
1. Researchers must create a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.
5. Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are atomic and extracted from the law article appropriately.
- Criterion 2: There are no clauses starting with "if" in the provided law article, making this criterion not applicable.

**Choice 2:**
1. Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.
2. Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.
3. Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.
4. Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan.
5. Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are clear, atomic, and accurately reflect the requirements from the law article.
- Criterion 2: Similar to Choice 1, there are no "if" clauses present in the law article.

**Choice 3:**
1. Researchers must have a written research plan.
2. Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
3. Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.
4. Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.
5. Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.

*Analysis:*
- Criterion 1: The statements are atomic and extracted correctly from the law article.
- Criterion 2: Again, there are no "if" clauses in the law article.

**Conclusion:**
All three choices effectively meet Criterion 1 by providing atomic statements that reflect the requirements of the research plan as outlined in the law article. Criterion 2 is not applicable in any case as there are no conditional clauses ("if"). However, the phrasing of the atomic statements varies slightly among the choices.

Choice 1 uses "create," which implies initiation, whereas Choice 2 uses "prepare," which may suggest a more formalized process. Choice 3 uses "have," which may lack the emphasis on the structured nature of the plan. The terms in Choice 2 ("prepare," "describe," and "indicate") are more aligned with formal documentation processes which researchers are likely to engage in, thus providing a clearer, more standardized understanding of the requirements.

Considering all of these factors, "The best choice is 2."
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Researchers must create a research plan in writing.**  
   - This is a clear and direct statement reflecting the requirement for a written document.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**  
   - This captures the requirement for listing affiliations, which is an atomic statement.

3. **Researchers must specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**  
   - This accurately reflects the need to clarify the nature and objectives of the research.

4. **Researchers must outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit of the research in the research plan.**  
   - This captures the expectation of stating benefits, but the word "outline" could be less precise than "specify."

5. **Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**  
   - This statement is suitable for capturing the requirement for additional matters.

**Analysis:** The wording is mostly clear and direct, but the use of "outline" could be seen as slightly less precise than "specify."

### Choice 2:
1. **Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing.**  
   - "Prepare" is a suitable term, similar to "create," and captures the requirement well.

2. **Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan.**  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and captures the requirement effectively.

3. **Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan.**  
   - "Describe" is appropriate and conveys a clear requirement.

4. **Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan.**  
   - "Indicate" is less strong than "specify," which could lead to ambiguity in what is required.

5. **Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan.**  
   - This is the same as Choice 1 and effectively captures the requirement.

**Analysis:** While this choice is mostly clear, the use of "indicate" may create ambiguity regarding the level of detail required.

### Choice 3:
1. **Researchers must have a written research plan.**  
   - "Have" is less definitive than "create" or "prepare," which could imply a lack of proactive engagement.

2. **Researchers must set out the affiliation of each person involved in the research.**  
   - "Set out" is a strong phrase but could be more specific in context compared to "include."

3. **Researchers must define the nature and objectives of the research.**  
   - "Define" is a strong term, clearly indicating the need for clarity in objectives.

4. **Researchers must articulate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate.**  
   - "Articulate" is a good choice, demanding a clear expression of anticipated benefits.

5. **Researchers must include all other prescribed matters related to the research.**  
   - This is consistent with previous choices and captures the requirement effectively.

**Analysis:** While this choice uses some strong verbs, the term "have" is weaker than the other choices, making it less suitable.

### Conclusion:
After detailed analysis based on the criteria, **Choice 1** provides the most precise and clear extraction of atomic statements from the law article, while effectively addressing the preconditions required for researchers. The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1:
1. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must create a research plan in writing."  
   - This statement is clear and directly reflects the requirement of having a written research plan.  

2. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."  
   - This captures the requirement to document affiliations, satisfying Criterion 1.

   - This aligns with the requirement to cover all other necessary aspects, satisfying Criterion 1.  

Overall, Choice 1 meets both criteria effectively.

### Choice 2:
1. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must prepare a research plan in writing."  
   - Similar to Choice 1, it states the requirement for a written plan but uses "prepare" instead of "create."  

2. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must include the affiliation of each person involved in the research in the research plan."  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and satisfies Criterion 1.  

3. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must describe the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan."  
   - The term "describe" is slightly less specific than "specify," but it still conveys the same meaning.  

4. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must indicate the public or scientific benefit of the research that they anticipate in the research plan."  
   - "Indicate" may also be seen as less strong than "outline," but still meets the criterion.  

5. **Atomic Statement**: "Researchers must address all other prescribed matters related to the research in the research plan."  
   - This is identical to Choice 1 and satisfies Criterion 1.  

Overall, Choice 2 also meets both criteria effectively, though some wording is less precise.

All three choices successfully meet both criteria. However, there are no significant differences in the quality or adherence to the criteria among them. Each choice presents the same content and structure, meaning they are nearly identical in their effectiveness.

Since all choices are valid, I conclude that the best choice is **1** based on the order of presentation, but it can be said that all choices are equally valid. 

The best choice is **1**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1:
- The choice effectively extracts atomic legal statements related to the obligations of researchers:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved in the research.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives of the research.
  4. Outline the anticipated public or scientific benefit.
  5. Address all other prescribed matters related to the research.

- **Criterion 1:** The actions described do not include preconditions, satisfying this criterion.
- **Criterion 2:** Each statement is classified as an obligation, which is appropriate as all actions are required by the researchers.

### Choice 2:
- This choice is similar to Choice 1 in that it extracts the same atomic legal statements and classifies them.
- The format is slightly different, but the essence remains unchanged:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives.
  4. Outline the anticipated benefits.
  5. Address prescribed matters.

- **Criterion 1:** Again, there are no preconditions included in the action descriptions.
- **Criterion 2:** All actions are classified as obligations, which is consistent with the requirements.

### Choice 3:
- Choice 3 also extracts the same statements and follows a similar classification process.
- The structure remains consistent with the previous choices, detailing:
  1. Create a research plan in writing.
  2. Include the affiliation of each person involved.
  3. Specify the nature and objectives.
  4. Outline the anticipated benefits.
  5. Address prescribed matters.

- **Criterion 1:** There are no preconditions cited in the action descriptions.
- **Criterion 2:** The classification of all actions as obligations is correct.

### Conclusion:
All three choices effectively extract and classify the legal statements. They all satisfy both criteria, but they differ mainly in formatting. Since there's no significant difference in the content or fulfillment of the criteria, any choice would be equally valid. However, if a preference for conciseness or clarity in presentation is desired, one might lean towards Choice 1 for its straightforward listing.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** The extraction is clear and accurately represents the obligations of the researchers based on the law article.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is categorized with the correct actor (Researchers), modal verb (must), modality (Obligation), and action(s). 
- **Precondition(s):** It explicitly states that there are no preconditions, adhering to Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are classified correctly as obligations, in line with Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** Similar to Choice 1, the extraction is accurate and comprehensive.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is formatted clearly with the necessary classifications. 
- **Precondition(s):** It also states that there are no preconditions, satisfying Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are classified as obligations, fulfilling Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Atomic Legal Statements Extraction:** The extraction remains consistent with the previous choices, accurately capturing the obligations.
- **Classification and Formatting:** Each statement is clearly outlined with the appropriate classifications. 
- **Precondition(s):** It states there are no preconditions, meeting Criterion 1.
- **Obligations:** All actions are correctly classified as obligations, adhering to Criterion 2.

### Conclusion:
All three choices successfully extract and classify the legal obligations of researchers as mandated by the law article. However, Choices 1, 2, and 3 are identical in their content and adherence to the criteria. Therefore, since they perform equally in the analysis, I will select the first choice as the best representation.

The best choice is 1.

Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Model Atomic Legal Statements in Legal GRL: 
Your task is create one Legal GRL model capturing the classified and formatted atomic legal statements from the previous step. Legal GRL is a DSML for modeling regulatory knowledge. Here is the Legal GRL syntax in TextX format:

Modeling steps: 
For each classified and formatted atomic legal statement, namely
Actor: description of actor
Modal Verb: ...
Modality: <Obligation or Permission>
Action(s): description of action(s)
Precondition(s): description of precondition(s)

1. If the Actor does not yet exist in the Legal GRL model, create a corresponding Actor in the model.

2. Create one «Goal», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal. The modality of the «Goal» is the Modality of the statement. The description of the «Goal» is the description of action(s) of the statement.

3. If the statement has preconditions, create one «Precondition», namely one IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition. The description of the «Precondition» is the description of precondition(s) of the statement.

4. Connect the «Precondition» created in step 3 to the «Goal» created in step 2  with a Dependency, whereby the «Precondition» is the source.

```
Model:
    actors = Actor: 
        name: "Researchers"
        intentionalElements = IE:
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE1"
                description: "Create a research plan in writing"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:

            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE3"
                description: "Specify the nature and objectives of the research in the research plan"
                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:
                id: "IE4"

                type: Goal
                modality: Obligation
            IntentionalElement:

;

EL: Dependency:
    source: IE1
    target: IE1
    // No preconditions for IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5 as well
```

**Note:** In the above model, each obligation represents a separate goal without preconditions; therefore, no dependencies are established since there are no preconditions to link them to. If any of the statements had specified preconditions, they would have been included as separate IntentionalElements with corresponding Dependency relationships.

 Let's analyze each choice based on the specified criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: There are no dependencies established from a «Precondition». All obligations (IE1 to IE5) are independent goals without preconditions.
   
2. **Criterion 2**: Again, there are no dependencies where a «Precondition» is the source, as there are no preconditions defined in this model.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements since all obligations are distinct.

**Conclusion**: This choice fails to meet both Criteria 1 and 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: Similar to Choice 1, there are no dependencies established from a «Precondition». Each obligation is treated independently without any preconditions.

2. **Criterion 2**: There are no dependencies with a «Precondition» as the source.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements.

**Conclusion**: This choice also fails to meet both Criteria 1 and 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Criterion 1**: This choice introduces a clear «Precondition» (IE6: "The research plan must exist"), which serves as the source of dependencies for obligations (IE1 to IE5). This satisfies Criterion 1.

2. **Criterion 2**: The dependencies are correctly established, with the «Precondition» (IE6) being the source and the target being the various obligations (IE1 to IE5). This satisfies Criterion 2.

3. **Criterion 3**: There are no duplicates among the intentional elements, as all goals are distinct.

**Conclusion**: This choice meets all three criteria, making it the best option.

Given this analysis, the best choice is **3**.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria:

### Choice 1:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: The model does not establish any preconditions for the obligations (Goals) related to the research plan. As a result, there are no dependencies created as the source of a dependency must be a precondition, which is absent here.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: All actions listed are classified as obligations; however, none of them are linked to a precondition.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate model elements since each goal is described uniquely.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** This choice fails to establish necessary dependencies as it lacks preconditions.

### Choice 2:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, this model does not establish any preconditions. As a result, each obligation is self-referential, which does not satisfy the requirement of dependencies.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: The elements are correctly categorized as obligations.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicate elements.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** This choice also fails to establish necessary dependencies due to the absence of preconditions.

### Choice 3:
1. **Precondition and Dependency**: This model introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist." This precondition is linked to all subsequent obligations (Goals) regarding the research plan, fulfilling the criteria for a source of dependency.
2. **Obligation or Permission**: All actions are categorized as obligations, and they depend on the existence of the research plan.
3. **Duplication of Model Elements**: There are no duplicates since each element has a unique description.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice meets all criteria. It establishes a clear precondition that is linked to the obligations, thus creating the necessary dependencies.

After analyzing all choices based on the given criteria, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze each choice based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: No preconditions are specified for any of the obligations. Thus, there are no sources for Dependencies that meet the criterion of being a Precondition.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: There are no valid Dependencies established because the sources of Dependencies are not Preconditions, violating Criterion 2.

3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicate descriptions among the IntentionalElements.

Overall, this choice does not meet the criteria for establishing Dependencies due to the lack of Precondition elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: Similar to Choice 1, this choice lacks any Precondition elements. There are no sources for Dependencies that qualify as Preconditions.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: The established Dependencies all point back to the same goal (self-dependency), which does not fulfill the requirement of having a source as a Precondition and a target as an Obligation or Permission.

3. **Duplication Check**: No duplicates are present among the IntentionalElements.

This choice also does not satisfy the criteria for establishing valid Dependencies due to the absence of Precondition elements.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Precondition Requirement**: This choice includes a Precondition: "The research plan must exist." This serves as a valid source for Dependencies.
   
2. **Dependency Validity**: The Dependencies are established from the Precondition to each of the obligations, fulfilling the requirements of Criterion 2. Each obligation regarding the research plan is dependent on the existence of the research plan, which is valid.

3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates in the descriptions of IntentionalElements.

This choice successfully meets all criteria for model validity, establishing the necessary Dependencies and ensuring no duplication.

### Conclusion:

After a thorough analysis of each choice against the defined criteria, it is clear that the only choice that fulfills all conditions is Choice 3. 

The best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail in light of the criteria provided.

**Choice 1 Analysis:**
- The model extracts obligations but does not establish any dependencies because there are no preconditions identified. 
- As per Criterion 1, there is no «Precondition» that serves as the source of a Dependency.
- Criterion 2 is not met either, as there are no dependencies established between a «Precondition» and an «Obligation» or «Permission».
- Criterion 3 is satisfied as there are no duplications in the descriptions of the model elements.

**Conclusion for Choice 1:** This choice does not fulfill the necessary criteria, especially regarding dependencies.

---

**Choice 2 Analysis:**
- Similar to Choice 1, this choice also extracts obligations, but again fails to establish valid dependencies.
- Criterion 1 is not satisfied because no «Precondition» is present as a source of a Dependency.
- Criterion 2 remains unmet for the same reason; there are no connections between «Precondition» and «Obligation».
- Criterion 3 is satisfied since there are no duplicate descriptions.

**Conclusion for Choice 2:** This choice also fails to meet the dependency criteria.

---

**Choice 3 Analysis:**
- This choice extracts obligations and introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist."
- Criterion 1 is satisfied as the precondition (IE6) serves as the source for dependencies.
- Criterion 2 is also satisfied as the dependencies link the precondition (IE6) to the obligations (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5).
- Criterion 3 is satisfied as there are no duplicate descriptions, and all elements have unique identifiers.

**Conclusion for Choice 3:** This choice fully meets all the criteria, establishing valid dependencies based on a precondition and maintaining uniqueness in model elements.

---

After careful analysis, the best choice is 3.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Let's analyze each choice in detail based on the given criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: No intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition is included as the source of any Dependency. Thus, the Dependency relationships cannot be established.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The lack of a Precondition means that the source of the Dependency does not meet the requirement to link an obligation or permission.
3. **Duplication Check**: The model contains no duplication of elements. Each goal statement is unique.

### Conclusion for Choice 1
Choice 1 fails to meet both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2. Thus, it cannot be deemed a valid model.

---

### Choice 2 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: Similar to Choice 1, there is no intentional element of type Goal with modality Precondition included as a source for any Dependency.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The self-referential Dependencies do not establish meaningful relationships since they do not involve a valid Precondition.
3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates; all goals are stated distinctly.

### Conclusion for Choice 2
Choice 2 also fails to meet Criterion 1 and Criterion 2, rendering it an invalid model.

---

### Choice 3 Analysis
1. **Precondition Dependency**: This choice introduces a precondition: "The research plan must exist," which is a Goal with modality Precondition.
2. **Dependency Validity**: The Dependencies are established correctly, as the source of each Dependency (the precondition) is linked to the respective obligations (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5, IE1). This meets the criteria that the source of a Dependency must be a Precondition and the target must be either an Obligation or Permission.
3. **Duplication Check**: There are no duplicates present; all elements are unique.

### Conclusion for Choice 3
Choice 3 meets all criteria effectively, establishing proper dependencies and ensuring that there are no duplications. 

The best choice is **3**.

You are a domain modeling expert that creates a domain model with a given purpose:
Generate Legal GRL models from law articles.
Create the model from the perspective of the focal actors: Researchers.

The model is created using the following domain:
(2) A research plan must be in writing and must set out,
(a) the affiliation of each person involved in the research; 
(b) the nature and objectives of the research and the public or scientific benefit of the research that the researcher anticipates; and 
(c) all other prescribed matters related to the research.

Your task is to Refine Legal GRL model: 
Your task is to refine «Obligations», «Permissions» and «Preconditions» in the Legal GRL model created in the previous step. Your output, namely the refined Legal GRL model, should be formatted with the Legal GRL syntax defined by a TextX grammar.

 

— begin of Legal GRL Syntax —

Model:
    actors = Actor*
    elementLinks = EL*
;

Actor: 'Actor:'
    'name:' name=STRING
    intentionalElements = IE*

IE: 'IntentionalElement:'

intentionalElementType: /Softgoal|Goal|Task/;

decompositionType: /AND|XOR|OR/;

Dependency: 'Dependency:'
    'source:' source=[IE]
    'target:' target=[IE]
;

Constraint 1: A «Precondition», namely an IntentionalElement of type Goal with modality Precondition, must be the target of a Dependency.

Constraint 2: The target of a Dependency must be «Precondition», and the source of a Dependency must be either an «Obligation» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Obligation, or an «Permission» namely an IntentionalElement of of type Goal with modality Permission.

— end of Legal GRL Syntax —

Refinement steps:
(1) For each «Precondition» or each «Obligations» or each «Permissions», analyse its description in natural language and rewrite it into a propositional logic formula. Use the 'and', 'or' in the description as indicators for logical connectors, and only break the description at that level of granularity.

Let us take a «Precondition» as the running example. The instructions apply to «Obligations» and «Permissions» in the same way.

Running example: suppose the description of the «Precondition» P is: a student informs a student, or informs a teacher who does not teaches the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Analyse this description, we get the following propositions:
A: a student informs a student.
B: a student informs a teacher.
C: the teacher does not teach the student.
D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.

The example description is translated to the following propositional formula:
A or (B and (C or D)).

(2) If the propositional logic formula contains two or more proposition connected with logical connectors, build the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example formula: A or (B and (C or D))

The syntax tree is:
       OR
       /         A    AND
            /             B  OR
               /                C     D


(3) For each non-root node in the tree:
create one sub IntentionalElement with appropriate description.

For the running example, we create 6 sub «Preconditions» P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_AND_B_OR, and P_OR_C_D, corresponding to the 6 non-root nodes, with the following descriptions respectively:
P_A: a student informs a student.
P_B: a student informs a teacher.
P_C: the teacher does not teach the student.
P_D: the teach has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_AND_B_OR: a student informs a teacher who does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.
P_OR_C_D: The teacher does not teach the student or has no conflict of interest with the student.

Note that the 6 newly created sub IntentionalElements are all «Preconditions», not «Obligations» nor «Permissions», because in the example, we are decomposing a «Precondition» P.

(4) Connect the original IntentionalElement to the created set of sub IntentionalElements with Decompositions whereby the decompositionTypes correspond to the logical connectors in the propositional logic formula. Follow the levels of the syntax tree of the propositional logic formula.

For the running example given above:
syntax tree level 1: «Precondition» P is decomposed into «Precondition» P_A and «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR with an 'OR' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 2: «Precondition» P_AND_B_OR is decomposed into «Precondition» P_B and «Precondition» P_OR_C_D with an 'AND' Decomposition.

syntax tree level 3: «Precondition» P_OR_C_D is decomposed into «Precondition» P_C and «Precondition» P_D with an 'OR' Decomposition.

(5) Create contribution links to defines the level of impact that the satisfaction of a source IntentionalElement has on the satisfaction of a destination IntentionalElement. The level of impact is between [-100, 100], with 100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently makes the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement, and -100 meaning the satisfaction of the source IntentionalElement sufficiently breaks the satisfaction of the destination IntentionalElement. Draw contribution links among goals or soft goals when pertinent.

INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 1:
 ### Analysis of Choices

#### Choice 1:
In this choice, the model effectively captures the obligations and dependencies related to the creation of a research plan by researchers. The intentional elements are all categorized correctly as "Obligations," and the precondition indicating that "The research plan must exist" is clearly linked to all other obligations. 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: The decomposition of obligations and preconditions adheres to the requirement that only elements of the same type and modality are decomposed. All intentional elements are categorized under the "Obligation" modality.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The model satisfies this criterion as the target of the decomposition (IE6) is linked to multiple obligations (IE1 through IE5), ensuring that the precondition is relevant to more than one intentional element.

#### Choice 2:
Choice 2 presents a similar structure but introduces additional intentional elements (IE7 and IE8) that also serve as preconditions. 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: This model maintains the correct decomposition of intentional elements, as all obligations are classified under "Obligation" and preconditions under "Precondition." However, the introduction of multiple preconditions may unnecessarily complicate the model.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: The model still fulfills this criterion, with preconditions being relevant to multiple obligations. However, the addition of unnecessary preconditions could detract from clarity.

#### Choice 3:
Choice 3 closely mirrors Choice 1 but includes a redundant precondition (IE7). 

- **Criterion 1 Compliance**: The classification of intentional elements remains intact, adhering to the same modality across obligations and preconditions.
  
- **Criterion 2 Compliance**: This choice also maintains compliance with the criterion as preconditions are linked to multiple obligations. However, the redundancy noted in the additional precondition suggests an inefficiency.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the choices based on the specific criteria for the domain modeling of legal GRL models from law articles, it is clear that while all choices have their merits, Choice 1 stands out as the most efficient and clear representation of the obligations and dependencies without unnecessary complexity.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 2:
 To evaluate the three choices for creating a Legal GRL model based on the provided legal requirements for researchers in the domain of writing research plans, we will analyze each choice against the stated criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: The model adheres to Criterion 1, as all intentional elements are obligations and preconditions that are appropriately grouped. Each obligation is linked only to its relevant precondition.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied, as each precondition connects to multiple obligations, ensuring the target of the decomposition is more than one intentional element.

### Choice 2 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: This choice also respects Criterion 1 by maintaining the decomposition within the same modality types (obligations and preconditions). The model reflects a clear structure of obligations and the necessary precondition for the existence of the research plan.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is met as well, with each precondition linking to multiple obligations.

### Choice 3 Analysis:

1. **Decomposition Validity**: This choice follows Criterion 1 strictly, ensuring that all intentional elements maintain their respective modalities. The obligations are clearly defined, and the precondition is correctly positioned.
2. **Multiplicity Requirement**: Criterion 2 is satisfied through the connections between the precondition and multiple obligations.

### Conclusion:
All three choices effectively meet both criteria. However, there are differences in their complexity and clarity. 

- **Choice 1** is the most straightforward and clear, with a simple model structure that doesn’t introduce unnecessary additional elements. 
- **Choice 2** introduces an additional precondition but maintains clarity in its intent.
- **Choice 3** adds complexity without significant benefit, making it less preferable.

Given the analysis, while all models are valid, the simplest and clearest structure is found in **Choice 1**.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 3:
 Let's analyze the three choices based on the specified criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: All intentional elements are obligations and are decomposed appropriately:
  - The model correctly identifies and links the precondition "The research plan must exist" (IE6) to the obligations that depend on it (IE1, IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5). This satisfies Criterion 1.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: The model includes one precondition (IE6) that targets multiple obligations (IE1-IE5), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 2 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: Similar to Choice 1, all intentional elements are of the same type (obligations), and the decomposition correctly links the precondition to the obligations.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: The model also targets multiple obligations from a single precondition (IE6), thus satisfying Criterion 2.

### Choice 3 Analysis
- **Decomposition**: This choice also maintains the same structure as the first two, with all intentional elements being obligations. The precondition links are appropriate.
  
- **Targets of Decomposition**: It effectively utilizes the precondition (IE6) to target multiple obligations (IE1-IE5), satisfying Criterion 2.

### Conclusion
All three choices effectively meet both criteria regarding decomposition and the targets of decomposition. However, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 have a streamlined approach without the redundancy seen in Choice 3, where there are extra intentional elements that repeat the same obligation regarding the existence of the research plan.

Between Choices 1 and 2, both are essentially equivalent in structure and fulfillment of requirements. However, Choice 1 presents a clearer and more concise model without repetitive intentional elements, making it easier to understand and more in line for implementation.

Thus, the best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 4:
 To evaluate the three choices of domain modeling for generating Legal GRL models from law articles from the perspective of researchers, we will analyze each option based on the provided criteria.

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: This model adheres to Criterion 1 by only decomposing Intentional Elements of the same type and modality. All obligations are categorized under the modality of "Obligation" and "Precondition" is treated separately.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is satisfied as the decomposed elements (IE2 to IE5) all depend on the existence of the research plan (IE6).
- **Overall Structure**: This model effectively links obligations to the required preconditions and provides a clear representation of the relationships between the elements.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: Like Choice 1, this model correctly maintains the decomposition rules as per Criterion 1. All intentional elements are obligations or preconditions, and none are inappropriately mixed.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied, as the dependencies are clear and linked to the precondition of the research plan's existence.
- **Additional Elements**: This model introduces additional preconditions (IE7 and IE8) that add complexity. However, it does not enhance clarity regarding the obligations, making the model somewhat convoluted.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: Criterion 1 is adhered to, as it follows the same structure as the previous choices by ensuring that decomposition is only amongst similar modalities.
- **Target of Decomposition**: Criterion 2 is also satisfied without issue. The linkages to the preconditions are clear and logically structured.
- **Redundancy**: This model includes redundant preconditions (IE6 and IE7), which do not contribute additional value to the clarity of the model. This could lead to confusion regarding the necessity of each condition.

### Conclusion:
While all three models adhere to the criteria, Choice 1 stands out for its clarity and simplicity. It effectively captures the required obligations without introducing unnecessary complexity or redundancy, which is crucial for researchers who will be using the model to generate legal GRL models.

The best choice is 1.
INFO:tree_of_thought.search:Evaluator 5:
 Analyzing the three choices based on the given criteria:

### Choice 1 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - The model correctly decomposes obligations (IE1 to IE5) into individual obligations with a precondition (IE6) that "The research plan must exist." This follows Criterion 1 as all decompositions are between the same type (Obligations) and modality.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The model has multiple dependencies from the precondition (IE6) to the obligations (IE1 to IE5). This meets Criterion 2 as at least one intentional element is targeted (IE2, IE3, IE4, IE5, IE1).
- **Overall Structure**: 
    - The model is well-structured and maintains clarity in the obligations and dependencies.

### Choice 2 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - Similar to Choice 1, this choice also decomposes the obligations correctly. It maintains the same type and modality among the intentional elements.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The precondition (IE6) links to multiple obligations (IE1 to IE5), meeting Criterion 2 effectively.
- **Additional Elements**: 
    - This choice introduces unnecessary duplication of preconditions (IE7 and IE8), which could complicate the model and does not add value.

### Choice 3 Analysis:
- **Decomposition**: 
    - The structure follows the same pattern as Choices 1 and 2 with correct decomposition.
- **Target of Decomposition**: 
    - The model's dependencies from IE6 to various obligations remain intact, fulfilling Criterion 2.
- **Clarity**: 
    - However, like Choice 2, this choice introduces redundancy with repeated precondition statements (IE7). 

### Conclusion:
Upon evaluation, both Choice 1 and Choice 2 correctly follow the decomposition rules and target multiple intentional elements. However, Choice 1 is the most concise and avoids redundancy present in Choices 2 and 3, making it clearer and easier to understand.

Thus, "The best choice is 1."
