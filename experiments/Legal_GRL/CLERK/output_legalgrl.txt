### Refine Legal GRL model:

#### Refinement of Obligations and Permissions:
- For **Tax Authority**:
  - **Obligation**: "ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
    - Propositional Logic: A
      - A: "all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
  - **Obligation**: "ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
    - Propositional Logic: B AND C
      - B: "all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time."
      - C: "required connection and metering points are established."

- For **Consumer**:
  - **Permission**: "have the right to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
    - Propositional Logic: D
      - D: "have the right to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice."
