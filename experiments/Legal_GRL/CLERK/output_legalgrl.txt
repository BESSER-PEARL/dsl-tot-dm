### Refine Legal GRL model:

1. **Obligation IE2**: ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   
   Propositional Logic:
   - A: all customers have more than one electricity supply contract.
   - B: required connection and metering points are established.

   Formula: A and B.

   Syntax Tree:
   ```
       AND
       /       \
      A         B
   ```

   Sub Intentional Elements:
   - IE2_A: all customers have more than one electricity supply contract.
   - IE2_B: required connection and metering points are established.

   Connections:
   - Decomposition: IE2 decomposed into IE2_A and IE2_B with an 'AND' decomposition.

2. **Permission IE4**: have the right to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time.
   
   Propositional Logic:
   - C: consumer has more than one electricity supply contract.
   - D: required connection and metering points are established.

   Formula: C and D.

   Syntax Tree:
   ```
       AND
       /       \
      C         D
   ```

   Sub Intentional Elements:
   - IE4_C: consumer has more than one electricity supply contract.
   - IE4_D: required connection and metering points are established.

   Connections:
   - Decomposition: IE4 decomposed into IE4_C and IE4_D with an 'AND' decomposition.
